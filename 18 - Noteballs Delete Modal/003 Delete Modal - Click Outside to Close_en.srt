1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:03,830
It would be better if this modal closed itself.

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:06,490
If we clicked anywhere outside of the card.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,540
That's the kind of functionality we would expect from a modal like this.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:19,240
And remember, we used that outside composable earlier from view use to make this mobile nav menu disappear

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,410
when we click outside of it.

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,690
So we could use that again here.

7
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:29,960
But before we do that, I don't like the fact that there's no putting around this model when we're on

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,210
a smaller screen.

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,030
Get a lot better with a little bit putting.

10
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,080
So this started with the class of modal.

11
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,260
This kind of class of pay us to.

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,250
To give that a little bit padding that looks a bit better, I think.

13
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,560
Okay, so let's use that.

14
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,990
Click outside composable here so that we can close this modal when we click outside of the card.

15
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,840
So I want to jump to the Explorer.

16
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:02,290
I'm just going to right click the source folder and choose find in folder and search for click outside

17
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:04,780
and there is it on up.

18
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:05,860
So let's jump to that.

19
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:15,730
So I'm going to copy this import and then jump to modal delete now dot view and add this to the top.

20
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,430
So imports paste that there.

21
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,890
Jump back to you, not part of you.

22
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,920
Now let's copy all of this code.

23
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:32,440
We might as well copy the comment as well and jump back to delete modal.

24
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,350
I will paste this at the bottom.

25
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,010
So remember we need a template ref.

26
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:45,160
To tell this composable which element we're going to be clicking outside of.

27
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,110
To then do something.

28
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:55,080
So let's replace this snap menu here and here with what we're going to be clicking outside of this modal

29
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,400
dash card diff.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,110
So we could call this modal card ref.

31
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,700
And then let's add this to the modal card.

32
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:12,720
Split the attributes of this ref, modal card ref.

33
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,010
Save the.

34
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:19,370
And I don't think we're going to need this ignore option.

35
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,900
So I'm just going to remove.

36
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,920
This third parameter, this object and this comma as well.

37
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,180
Like that.

38
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,090
And we can get rid of this data ref, which we were adding to that ignore option.

39
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,410
Now, when we do click outside, we just want to hide the modal by triggering this.

40
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:46,200
Method close modal so we can actually just select all of this, handle the hair from the closing curly

41
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,260
brace to these parentheses.

42
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,500
I just put the name of method close modal.

43
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,290
So let's save that.

44
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,230
See if that's working.

45
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,040
Reload show the modal and we have an error here.

46
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,320
Ref is not defined.

47
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,890
I guess we need to import the ref method from view.

48
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,390
So import ref from view.

49
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,250
Save that reload.

50
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:15,690
Show the modal click outside on.

51
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:16,530
Yeah, it's working.

52
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:22,230
Let's just make sure it's not being triggered erroneously like it was on the knop before.

53
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:24,330
Yeah.

54
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,840
It only gets fired if we click right outside of the card and the console and x buttons are still working.

1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:07,150
We usually expect to be able to close a motel like this by hitting the escape key on our keyboard.

2
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:15,310
So let's set up some keyboard handling in the mounted hook of this modal delete note w component.

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:23,200
So I'm going to jump to modal delete note W on down to the bottom and I'll create a comment called Keyboard

4
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,160
Control.

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,020
I'm a lot and on mount it took.

6
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:37,820
Toss in a handler to that like that and we'll just log out on mount it for now.

7
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,880
Say that we have an error here on Mount.

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,870
It is not defined.

9
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:50,660
Find us because we need to import this lifecycle from view so that's out it on mounted save that reload

10
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:58,390
show the modal I can see on mount it being locked out and if we hide it and show it again we can say

11
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,990
on Mount it is locked out again.

12
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:06,350
So now inside our mounted hook, let's set up an event listener for the key event.

13
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,170
Which will be fired after we press key and then let go of it.

14
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:18,810
So let's get rid of this lock and we can just do document, dot, add event listener parentheses and

15
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,190
then follow the first parameter.

16
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,230
This is the event we're going to listen out for and we're going to listen out for the key event.

17
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,690
And the second parameter is our handler.

18
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:33,000
So let's add an arrow function here and let's also passing the event object.

19
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,640
I'll replace these parentheses with an E and then we'll just lock that out for now.

20
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:50,430
So console log a save that and reload show a modal and hit the escape key and we can see the keyboard

21
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,790
event being locked out there.

22
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,740
Within this event object, we can see that when we hit the escape key, this key property is set to

23
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:05,490
escape and this key property is generally the property that we want to check in our JavaScript to determine

24
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:05,970
which.

25
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,180
Key was pressed.

26
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,480
So let's check if the escape key was pressed.

27
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:17,660
And if so, then we can just fire a closed modal method, thus hiding the modal.

28
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:22,910
So let's remove this console lock and we can just do f e dot.

29
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,620
Key is equal to escape.

30
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:33,470
Then you can just fire the close modal method and save that.

31
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,320
Reload.

32
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,230
Show the moto and hit the escape key.

33
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,240
And that's working.

34
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,680
We see the modal disappear.

35
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,290
However, we do have an issue here.

36
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,710
If we look something out inside this event.

37
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,130
Listener.

38
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,980
We could just log out, close it.

39
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:57,610
Save that and if I reload, click on delete to show the modal and hit escape.

40
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,910
Then we see close it being locked out once.

41
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:07,990
But if I show another modal on here escape, it's now been logged out twice this time.

42
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,350
And if we show a modal again and hit escape this time it's been locked out three times.

43
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:21,070
And this is because even after the modal is closed, this event listener still exists.

44
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,150
This event listener is not being removed when we close the modal.

45
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,980
So when we first show a modal, this event listener is set up.

46
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,160
Then we closed the motel.

47
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,540
This is still sets up.

48
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:38,380
Then we open another motel and we then sets up a second event list.

49
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:38,570
Now.

50
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:44,760
So at this point, we now have two of these event listeners firing and it will keep adding a new event

51
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,770
list every time we show a new model.

52
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:55,090
So what we need to do is remove this event listener when the model is closed and we can do this in the

53
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,650
on mounted hook, which will be fired when our model is removed from the domain.

54
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:07,180
Now, first, to make an event listener removable, we need to put its callback function into its own

55
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,350
named function.

56
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,840
So both are mounted hook.

57
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:22,029
I'm going to create a constant called handle keyboard set equal to an arrow function in the eight parameter

58
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,680
the event object.

59
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,250
Now I'm going to cut these two lines.

60
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,110
I'm paste them into this new function.

61
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:38,400
And now we can just select all of this handler from the closing curly brace.

62
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,400
Up to the age.

63
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:45,710
I'm just passing in the name of this function handle keyboard.

64
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,670
So let's save that and make sure that's still working.

65
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:52,870
Hit the escape gate.

66
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,170
And yet that's still working.

67
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:01,180
So now we just need to remove this event list, not in the on mounted hook.

68
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:09,610
So after the on mounted hook will harden on on mounted hook percent arrow function handler.

69
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,310
Now to remove this event list, now we can just use the remove event list.

70
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:15,820
No method.

71
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:23,980
So I'm just going to copy all of this line paste line here and change out event list not to remove event

72
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,840
list to save that.

73
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:29,920
And we do need to add the on on mounted hook to our imports.

74
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,490
So let's add that here on on.

75
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,310
Mounted.

76
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:35,720
Save that.

77
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:37,910
Now let's see if this is working.

78
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,160
So click the delete button.

79
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,710
Show the model here.

80
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:42,260
Escape.

81
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,340
And we see our log being fired only once.

82
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:53,520
Click Delete again show the moto hit escape and we now see close it only being logged out once again.

83
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,650
So this is not working.

84
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:00,150
That event last night is being removed when the modal is closed and if we keep it an escape here, we

85
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,500
don't see anything locked out.

86
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:08,760
So we can now just remove that console.log from the handle keyboard function saved up.

87
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,510
And now all we need to do is delete this sucker when the user clicks on delete in the modal.

1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:08,220
So if the user clicks on this cancel button, all this X button, then we want to hide this modal.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,600
Now these buttons are in our child component modal to the note dot view.

3
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:20,700
But if the user clicks these buttons, then we want to modify the models dot delete note property,

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,500
which is on the parent component.

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,040
And one way we could do this is by emitting a custom event.

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,009
Let me click on these buttons and then in the parent component note dot view listening out.

7
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,490
For that event and when it's received.

8
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,030
Set models dot delete note but to false.

9
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,620
However, as we learned earlier in the course, we don't actually need to do this.

10
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,240
We can get a child component.

11
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:55,200
To directly modify a data property which is on its parent component by passing this reactive data property

12
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:03,210
down to the child component using V model, then receiving the value of the model, using the special

13
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:10,620
model value prop and then updating the source of that model value on the parent component by using update

14
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,490
model value.

15
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:18,360
Well, first of all, let's pass down model's dot delete note to the child component using V model.

16
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,170
So let's jump up to our model delete note component here.

17
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,390
I'm allowed a V model directive and set that to the same as the V.

18
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:35,460
If so, models dot delete note paste that in there save that we can now receive this v model using the

19
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,610
special model value prop on the child component.

20
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:48,300
So let's jump to model delete note view at the script section on the setup attribute and the sets of

21
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:48,990
props.

22
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,940
So a lot of comment here which says props.

23
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:59,100
I'm a lot of constant call props set by equal to the define props method percent and object.

24
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,540
I will define our props here.

25
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:08,759
So to receive this data property that we're passing down with V model, we need to use the model value

26
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:11,550
prop set that equal to an object.

27
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:17,640
The type is going to be boolean because models up to the know is a billion.

28
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,230
It's only going to be true or false.

29
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:23,430
I we'll set the default to false and save that.

30
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:29,340
And to make sure this is being passed down correctly and received correctly, let's just output this

31
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,040
model value prop in our template.

32
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:39,750
So after the text that we added to the body without a pre tag and just output double curly braces and

33
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:47,580
model value, save that, I'll just reload the app, click on delete and yeah, we can see that's going

34
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,010
through because we can see true here.

35
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,120
Now let's just remove this pre tuck and save that.

36
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:59,130
Now let's create a method that can be fired when we click on the x button or the console button.

37
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:07,380
So let's jump down to the script section in modal delete note dot view on a section called Close Modal

38
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:14,730
and I'll create a constant called Close Modal set that equal to an arrow function.

39
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,950
And for now we'll just log out Close Modal, save that.

40
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,280
Now let's trigger this method on buttons.

41
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,720
So the council button is going to break this up onto multiple lines.

42
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:34,440
Split the attributes I'm allowed to click on the UT Click Equals Close Modal.

43
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,720
Then I'm going to copy this.

44
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,540
Click on let find this little button.

45
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,310
Where is that thing?

46
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:42,810
Oh, here it is.

47
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:49,440
I'll split that onto multiple lines and split the attributes I'm just paste in that click on.

48
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:56,100
Let say that unless make sure this close modal method is firing.

49
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,840
Click on the console button.

50
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,590
We see the lock click on the X button and we see the log.

51
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:07,290
So now we just need to omit the update model value event in this method.

52
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,050
So first of all, we need to define our omits.

53
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:18,660
So let's order omits section create a constant called omit set that equal to the defined limits method,

54
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:26,670
pass in an array and we'll just add the updates called on modal value.

55
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,930
Save that and we can now omit this special event.

56
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:37,410
So in our closed modal method we can just to omit and then.

57
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,710
Update model value.

58
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:47,570
So this is going to change the source data property in the parent component that we're passing down

59
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,290
with the model and receiving with model value.

60
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:55,900
So it's going to update this delete note property in the parent component note dot view.

61
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,690
So we need to tell it what value to set it to and we want to hide the modal.

62
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,480
So we want to set this back to false.

63
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,060
So let's jump down to this emit.

64
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,060
We can just add false as a second parameter.

65
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,460
Let's save that and see if it's working.

66
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:12,920
Show the delete model.

67
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,560
Click on the X and that's working.

68
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,650
Click on Cancel and that's working as well.

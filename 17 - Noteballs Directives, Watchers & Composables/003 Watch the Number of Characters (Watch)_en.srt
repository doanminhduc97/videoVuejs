1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,280
Lazada watcher to this up.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:08,189
So let's say on our notes page view notes dot view, we want to watch the number of characters that

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:13,530
are being entered into this text area or in other words, the number of characters in this new note

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,630
ref that's on view notes dot view.

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,770
And if that gets to 100 characters, we want to show an alert.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,650
So let's add a watcher to do this on View Notes.

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,380
W So do you remember how we add a watcher?

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:25,920
That's right.

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,260
We first need to import the watch method from view and we then use this watch method.

10
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:37,560
So at the bottom here, I'm going to add a new comment which says Watch characters and we'll use this

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,550
watch method.

12
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:44,400
And the first parameter is the data that we want to watch and we want to watch this new note ref so

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,010
we can just pass in new notes as the first parameter.

14
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:53,700
The second parameter is a method callback method which will be fired any time this data property that

15
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,350
specified here changes.

16
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,490
If we like, we can pass in the new value on the old value here.

17
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,780
So let's just log these out.

18
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:09,210
So a log out, new value and then comma u-value then I'll duplicate that I'm a log out old value, save

19
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:15,570
that reload and if we change the text we can see the old value in the new value always being locked

20
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:15,840
out.

21
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,940
Now we're not actually going to need the old value here, so I'll get rid of that and get rid of these

22
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:21,450
logs.

23
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:27,600
So if the character of this new note ref gets to 100, we're going to show an alert so we can just add

24
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:34,530
an F statement to do this so we can do if new value length to get the length of the new value is equal

25
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,050
to 100, then we can alert something.

26
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:42,180
So alert only 100 characters allowed.

27
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,900
Gosh darn it, save that reload.

28
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,210
Just to make it easier to test this, I'm going to jump to the underlying text area which is in source

29
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,940
components notes and add edit note dot view.

30
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,590
And I'm just going to add a max length attribute to this set that to 100.

31
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,600
So I thought, let's test this out.

32
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,300
We can just start typing into this text area.

33
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,150
And when we get to 100 characters, we see the alert so we can see that our watcher is working.

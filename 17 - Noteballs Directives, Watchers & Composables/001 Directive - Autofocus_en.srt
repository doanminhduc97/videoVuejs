1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,270
Let's add a custom directive to this up.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:10,230
And one thing we could do is create a custom directive which auto focuses this text area when the page

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:16,620
is loaded so that the user can immediately start typing a new notes without having to click into it.

4
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:23,490
So first of all, let's just set up a local custom directive inside this add edit note component and

5
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,750
that's in source components notes and at edit notes.

6
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:33,030
So we'll jump down to the script section and I'll jump down to the bottom.

7
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,300
Let's add a new comment here which says Directives.

8
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,460
So do you remember how we add a local custom directive?

9
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,090
Feel free to pass the video on, see if you can remember how to do it.

10
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,550
But what we do is we create a constant and we need to make sure the name of this constant starts with

11
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,700
a lowercase v and is in common case.

12
00:00:53,850 --> 00:01:01,260
So we could call this v auto focus and we set this equal to an object and we could add any hooks we

13
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,720
want in here, such as created or we're going to use mounted.

14
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:13,100
And we set this equal to a method like this and we can pass the L parameter in here on this L parameter.

15
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:20,070
It will give us access to the element once it's mounted, as in the element which we add this v auto

16
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,430
focus directive two.

17
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:29,910
So we can then just focus it with l dot focus and now we can just add this directive to any focus of

18
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,310
all element that's in this component.

19
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,980
So let's add it to text area which is here.

20
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:42,150
And remember, we need to change the name that we've used here from camel case into dash case so we

21
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,890
can up this like this v dash auto focus.

22
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,520
Save that.

23
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:53,460
And if we reload this page, we can see that the text area is automatically focused without us needing

24
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,750
to click into it.

25
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,420
Since this add edit note component is a shared component which is also used on the edit page.

26
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,130
It should also work here as well, which it does.

27
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:06,420
We can see the text area auto focused here as well.

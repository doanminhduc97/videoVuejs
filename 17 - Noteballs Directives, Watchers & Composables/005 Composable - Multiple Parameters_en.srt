1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:04,760
Let's make use watch characters composable a bit more flexible.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:11,270
So right now, the alert will always be fired when the length of the characters reaches 100.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,790
But let's say we want to be able to adjust the number of characters at which this fire's, let's say,

4
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:17,750
on the notes page.

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,880
We want to fire this 100 characters.

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,680
But on the stats page, in this input, we want to fire this up 50 characters.

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:31,490
Well, we could do this by adding another parameter to use what characters function here.

8
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:38,150
So let's add a second parameter here called max chars and we can pass the same on.

9
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,610
We use this composable in our components.

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,210
So in our if statement here instead of if new value length is equal to 100 or two, if new value dot

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,070
length is equal to max chars.

12
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:55,520
So I'll replace 100 with max chars and we'll also output this number in our alert as well.

13
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,670
So I'll change this to a template string.

14
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:03,600
So I'll replace the hundred with dollar curly braces.

15
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,780
I will output this max chars.

16
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:11,210
Let's get this max charles parameter a default value in case it's not been provided.

17
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,700
We can do that by just setting max chars equals to 100 save up.

18
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:23,240
And since we're not currently providing this Max Charles parameter on the notes page, then this should

19
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,500
just work as it did before by firing the alerts 100 characters.

20
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,340
So let's just test that on yet.

21
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,170
That's still working out 100 characters.

22
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:38,620
So let's say on our notes page, we just want to use the default functionality with 100 characters.

23
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,500
But on our stats page we want the max chars to be 50 characters.

24
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:47,450
So let's jump to the stats page and jump to views that stop view.

25
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:54,650
Let's scroll down to where we're triggering our composable passive in the second parameter of 50.

26
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,960
Now let's save that reload.

27
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,210
This should be firing a little bit sooner now.

28
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,120
50 characters on.

29
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:01,370
Yeah.

30
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,220
And our alert says only 50 characters allowed.

31
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:04,910
Gosh darn it.

32
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:09,320
And so composable is now a lot more flexible and useful.

33
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,580
And of course, we could make it more flexible with additional parameters, etc..

34
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:19,100
Now, for a simple composable like this, which only contains a watcher, then it makes sense to just

35
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:24,440
import the composable and just fire the composable function like we're doing here.

36
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:30,740
But for more complicated composable, which contain a bunch of different things such as data, methods,

37
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:36,020
computed properties, etc., then it makes more sense to only extract the things that we need from the

38
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:42,680
composable using restructuring and for a reminder of how we do that with more complex composable as

39
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,220
jump back to module 11, the composable module.

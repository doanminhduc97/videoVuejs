1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,810
Now let's say we have an input on our stats page.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,570
Let's jump to the stats page.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,380
So views view stats dot view a collapse table.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:16,710
I will add an input after this and I'll set the type to text and we'll give this a placeholder.

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,770
Do you love note balls?

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,310
Save that and jump to our stats page to make this look a bit prettier.

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,480
A lot of class of input, which is from Bulma and that's better.

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,570
So let's say we also want to auto focus this input when this page has loaded.

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,090
Well, that's not currently going to work.

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,830
If we add this v auto focus directive here.

11
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,270
Save that and reload.

12
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,240
If we look at our console we can see an error.

13
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,660
Cannot read properties of undefined reading deep.

14
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:52,300
And that's because this the auto focus doesn't exist within the context of this component view.

15
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,230
Start, stop view.

16
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:59,230
It only exists on the edit note top view component where we've set it up here.

17
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,880
So let's jump back to view.

18
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,720
Start, stop view.

19
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,420
Remove this the auto focus directive.

20
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,960
Save that and jump back to our notes page and add edit note up view.

21
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:15,160
Let's make this directive, a global directive that we can use anywhere.

22
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:20,590
So first of all, let's create a new folder in our source folder where all of our directives can live.

23
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:26,470
So going to right click the source folder, click on new folder, create a folder called Directives.

24
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,480
And inside that, we're going to create a new file called the Auto Focus.

25
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,710
We might as well give it the same name as our constant name.

26
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,410
Now let's jump to add edit note dot view.

27
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,300
Select this constant and cut it.

28
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,840
Let's also remove this comment and save that.

29
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,580
Now let's jump to our new auto focus file and paste that directive.

30
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:54,670
And all we need to do is export this so that it can be imported from our components, so we can just

31
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,470
start export like that.

32
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,540
Save that now if we want to add edit knocked out view, we can just import this directive.

33
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,550
So let's jump up to our imports.

34
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,230
We can just do imports.

35
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,430
Curly braces.

36
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:11,740
The auto focus from slash directives.

37
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,670
Slash the auto focus that I know.

38
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:19,330
We just need to add the directive to the text area which we already have done.

39
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:24,190
So this should hopefully be working now and we can see when we reload the page it still auto focuses

40
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:28,600
the text area, except now it's using this global directive that we created.

41
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,510
So let's use the same global directive on our stats page.

42
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,970
So let's jump to view, start, stop view.

43
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,800
We need to import the directive.

44
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,780
So I'll just jump back to edit note dot view and copy the import statement.

45
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,590
Job to view.

46
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,550
Stop, stop view.

47
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,660
Paste that here.

48
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,180
Save that and we can now use that here as well.

49
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,400
So let's add it to this import we just created.

50
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:55,900
So V dash auto focus save that reload and we can see this import on the start page is now auto focus

51
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,470
as well.

1
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:08,930
Now let's say we want to have the same watch characters functionality on our stats page on this input.

2
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:17,390
Well, we could just copy this, watch code, paste it into our stats page views that start view and

3
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:21,470
then just adjust the data property that we're watching here.

4
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,870
But then we'd be duplicating code.

5
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:29,750
It'd be better to put this watch into its own composable file, which we can use everywhere.

6
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,100
So let's do that.

7
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,080
Let's jump to our Explorer.

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,970
We want to put a composable in a folder called Use Inside the source folder.

9
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,570
So that's right click source and choose new folder.

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:51,290
Create a folder called Use and then inside that will create a new file called Use Watch Characters talks

11
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,940
to set up a composable.

12
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,940
We just need to export a function with the same name as our file.

13
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:05,330
So use watch characters like this.

14
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,120
Let's jump back to view notes that view.

15
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,510
Just call this watcher.

16
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,460
Jump to our composable and paste that in here.

17
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,170
And actually back on.

18
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:16,160
Do you notice that view?

19
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:23,750
We can now remove the watch method that we're importing, saved up and jump back to use watch characters.

20
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,120
And we do need to import this watch method here.

21
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,770
So let's just add import watch from view.

22
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:36,800
Now, in order to make this composable generic, we need to be able to pass in the data property that

23
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,110
we want to watch as a parameter.

24
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,910
So let's just accept that here.

25
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:45,200
So we could just call this value to watch or something like that.

26
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,650
Whatever we're passing in here is what we want to watch here.

27
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:53,500
So let's change new notes to value, to watch and save that.

28
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:59,780
And now we should be able to use this composable to watch the number of characters of any data property

29
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,500
within our app and then show this alert if it hits 100 characters.

30
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:07,340
So let's jump to view, note stock view and we need to import this composable.

31
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:23,240
So imports use watch characters from slash use slash use watch characters save up a stop to our notes

32
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:30,230
page, jump down to the bottom and we should not be able to use this composable to watch this new note

33
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:37,250
ref, which is bound to the text area so we can just to use watch characters and then pass in the ref

34
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,120
that we want to watch.

35
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,750
New note.

36
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,010
New notes.

37
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,300
Save that.

38
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,980
Let's see if that still working.

39
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,160
Yep, still working.

40
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:54,650
And now we should also be able to use the same functionality on our stats page.

41
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,720
So let's jump to our stats page.

42
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,870
Source views view stats dot view.

43
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,830
And again, we need to import this composable.

44
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:10,820
I'll just copy the import line from view notes dot view paste that here.

45
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,300
We should now be able to use it on the stats page as well.

46
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:19,370
However, we don't have a data property set up for this import here, so let's just set that up.

47
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:25,790
So a lot of comment here which says Love Note Balls, I will set up a ref.

48
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:32,540
So const love note balls equals a ref with an initial value of an empty string.

49
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,580
Now we need to import ref from view.

50
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:38,510
Let's add that to the top import ref from view.

51
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,080
Now let's bind this ref to the input.

52
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,020
So here's the input side of the model.

53
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,510
Set it to love note balls.

54
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,800
Save that.

55
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,040
Let's just change this default value to see if it's hooked up.

56
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:53,510
And yep, that's hooked up.

57
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,690
So we should now be able to watch the characters in this input.

58
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,660
So again, we can just to use watch characters pass in the ref that we want to watch, which is love

59
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,060
note balls, love note balls.

60
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,800
Save that and hopefully we should see the same functionality here.

61
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,710
And yeah, it's working.

1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,990
So we've created a custom composable.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,890
But let's also add a composable from the view use library.

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:11,780
And if we look at our mobile menu here currently, the only way we can close this is by clicking on

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:12,490
the X.

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:17,090
We can't close it by clicking outside of it like we would usually expect.

6
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:22,340
So let's use one of the composable from the view used library to solve this for us.

7
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,540
So let's jump over to view use dot org.

8
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:28,650
Get started.

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,290
We need to install this first.

10
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,140
So let's talk to our terminal killer.

11
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,890
That process will run this command to install.

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:38,730
If you use.

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,730
I'm not finished.

14
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:50,920
So let's relaunch our up with AMPM run death and on The View Use I'm going to go to menu core functions

15
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:56,920
census how we're going to use this on click outside composable.

16
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,060
So let's click on that.

17
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,580
We can see an example here.

18
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:06,470
We can open up a model and we can close it with the exporting, but we can also close it by clicking

19
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,970
anywhere outside of the model.

20
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:16,640
So let's hide the terminal here, close all of our components and open up the number, source components,

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,410
layout number.

22
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,440
And let's look at the example code here.

23
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:26,450
So we need to import the on click outside composable from view use.

24
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:31,100
So let's copy that line and add that to our import section here.

25
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:37,760
And we can see in this example here, we need to set up a template ref, add that ref to the element

26
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,900
before we can use this.

27
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:48,230
So let's find on up menu element which is here this Dave with the classic enough bar menu.

28
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,000
So let's add a rep to this.

29
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:56,150
We could call this number menu ref or something like that.

30
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,730
Let's jump down to the script section.

31
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:06,440
A lot of comment here which says Click outside to close.

32
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,320
We need to set up a template ref like we can see in this example here.

33
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:20,960
So we'll create a constant with the same name as our ref, which is what has it gone now from a new

34
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,310
ref?

35
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,350
So const nav bar menu.

36
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:29,480
Ref equals a ref with a default value of no.

37
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,870
And now we can use this composable.

38
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,160
So let's copy this line here.

39
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:37,890
Paste that here.

40
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,950
Change the target to this graph here.

41
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:41,970
So I'll copy that.

42
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,680
Paste that there.

43
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,060
Save that.

44
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,060
Now let's show the mobile menu.

45
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,940
Clear the console and click outside somewhere.

46
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,760
And we can see the events objects being locked out here.

47
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,040
So that seems to be working.

48
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,260
But we don't want to just log out the event object.

49
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,520
So I'm going to select all of that and add Kelly Braces and add a new line in the middle.

50
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:12,330
This show Mobile now determines whether or not the mobile menu is shown.

51
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,590
So we can just set this back to false once we've clicked outside.

52
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,450
So in this one click outside method, we can just do show mobile.

53
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:28,020
Now the value equals false and I'll just remove the event object from here because I'm not going to

54
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,830
need that saved up.

55
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:30,780
And let's see if it's working.

56
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,430
Show the menu.

57
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,940
Click outside and we see it disappears.

58
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:44,140
However, it's now not closing the mobile menu and we click on the X, so let's see if we can fix that.

59
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,440
Let's jump up to that button, which is here.

60
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,010
So I think I see what's happening here.

61
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:56,320
So our mobile menu is currently showing when we click on the burger button.

62
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,900
Well, because this is outside of.

63
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:06,670
Our mobile menu is triggering the on click outside event on settings show mobile now.

64
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,010
Back to false and hiding the mobile menu.

65
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,540
But because we also have this.

66
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,620
Click on the burger button.

67
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:22,220
This is then firing this code which is going to show mobile now to the opposite of itself.

68
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,070
So at this point, it's going to set it back to true.

69
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:33,410
And if we jump back to the on click outside documentation and scroll down a bit, we can actually add

70
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:36,230
an options object as a third parameter.

71
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:48,170
After the target and the handler where we can up this ignore option to tell the composable which elements

72
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:52,070
to ignore the on click outside functionality.

73
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:57,620
So we can just make it ignore all clicks on this not pop burger.

74
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:02,000
Now we need to set up a template ref first for this.

75
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,230
Now Bob Burger.

76
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,300
So let's add a ref to this.

77
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:09,800
Set that to nav bar burger ref.

78
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,450
Save that.

79
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:12,830
So down.

80
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,090
Now we need to set up our data ref for that hit.

81
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,380
So I'll duplicate this one.

82
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:22,700
Change this to contact number burger ref.

83
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,850
And then in this one, click outside.

84
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,410
Function.

85
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:34,310
After our handler function, we can add a comma and then an object.

86
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:44,900
And that inside that we cannot ignore option set that equal to an array of pass in the template ref.

87
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,890
Solve any elements we want this composable to ignore.

88
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,720
So let's pass in this.

89
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,450
Now popsugar paste that in there.

90
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,050
Save that.

91
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,540
Let's see if that's fixed.

92
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,990
Click on the button on yet.

93
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,480
We can still close it by clicking on the x.

94
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,780
Let's see if we can still click outside to close it.

95
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,460
And yes, we can.

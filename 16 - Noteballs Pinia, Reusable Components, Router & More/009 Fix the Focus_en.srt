1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:04,700
When we type in a new note, click the add new note Watson.

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:09,590
We can see the notes is added to our list and added to our opinion store.

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,180
To the notes are right in the state.

4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:15,770
However, the text area is not refocused and we see this error in the console.

5
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,200
Cannot read properties of note reading focus.

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,910
And that's because in view notes the view after we update notes to the notes are right in the store.

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:29,780
We're using this template ref, new note ref to grab the text area element and then focus it.

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:35,270
Well, this template ref new note ref no longer exists in this view notes component.

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:41,690
So let's remove this constant here which we set up for the template ref and also remove this line where

10
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:45,920
we were focusing the text area and find another way to do this.

11
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:52,790
One thing we could do instead is add a template ref to the add edit note component that we're displaying

12
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:59,120
here and use that template ref to get access to the child component, add, edit note and then fire

13
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,320
a method that sets it within the edit note few component.

14
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:10,460
So let's add a riff to this component and we'll call it add edit note ref save.

15
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,320
That will jump down to the bottom.

16
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:19,670
We need to set a data for this as well with the same name, so create a constant called add edit note

17
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:24,710
ref set not equal to a data ref with an initial value of note.

18
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:31,870
And now in a note method here after we clear the new note ref thus clearing the text area, we cannot

19
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:39,320
access the child component add edit note by using this template ref so we can do that edit notes ref

20
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:45,440
dot value to access that component and we can then trigger a method which is in that component.

21
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:50,150
So let's say we want to trigger a method called focus text area.

22
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,180
We can do this like that.

23
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:57,470
Now, we haven't set up this focus text area method yet, so let's save that.

24
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,920
And to add edit note dot view sets up this method.

25
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:09,830
So that's not a new section here with a comment which says focus text area and we'll create this method.

26
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:22,250
So const focus text area equals an arrow function on for now I'll just log out, focus text area and

27
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:22,880
save that.

28
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:29,900
So let's see if this method in the child component focus text area is being successfully triggered by

29
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,130
its parent component view.

30
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,210
Note Stop view here.

31
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,590
So let's reload.

32
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,520
And this method should be fired after we add a new note.

33
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,140
So let's type in some text.

34
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,010
Click on the button.

35
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,260
That's not worked and we see this error.

36
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,090
Edit Note ref dot value.

37
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:49,880
The focus text area is not a function, so it's not able to find this function that we just set up in

38
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,720
the child component.

39
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:58,010
And that's because when we're using the script setter pattern, we need to actually expose any methods

40
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:02,270
that we want to be made available to a component's parent component.

41
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,310
And we do this by using the define expose method.

42
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,200
We pass into that an object.

43
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:15,140
We just want to add in here any methods that we want to be made available to this component's parent

44
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:15,650
component.

45
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:21,710
So we want to make this focus text area method available so we can just add focus text area here.

46
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,020
So let's save that and see if that's not working.

47
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,810
Type in a note, hit the button.

48
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,920
Yet that's working.

49
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,620
Now we can say focus text area being locked out so operate component do you stop view is successfully

50
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:39,650
triggering this focus text area method on its child component to edit note dot view.

51
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:46,400
So now all we need to do in order to focus this text area is add another template ref to this text area

52
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,830
and then use that to focus it here.

53
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,160
So let's scroll up to the text area element on this text area still has a ref on it from before this

54
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,970
new note ref.

55
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,460
Well, this text area is not just for new notes anymore, it's also going to be used for editing notes.

56
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:09,140
So let's rename this ref to text area ref, which is a bit more generic and we'll use this ref to focus

57
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:09,950
the text area.

58
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,670
So let's jump down to our focus text area method.

59
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:18,350
And we also need to set up a data ref for this template ref with the same name.

60
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:24,500
So we want to do const text area ref set that equal to a ref with an initial value?

61
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:28,760
No, let's just check if we're importing the ref method from view and we're not.

62
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:37,580
So let's just add an import section at the top and we'll import ref from view.

63
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,160
Don't back down to method.

64
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:47,720
So now to get access to the text area element, we can just do text area ref dot value and then to focus

65
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,520
it, we can just fire the focus method.

66
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:57,530
So to focus save that and hopefully this should be working now type in a new note hit the button on

67
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,250
yeah it's worked.

68
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,330
We've added the new note.

69
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:03,620
We can see it on the page and we've also cleared the text area and focused it as well.

1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,810
This text area on the button are no longer working.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:09,000
And that's because this text area, which is in our new child component add edit note that view is no

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,350
longer hooked up to this new note ref which we set up in this do notes component.

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:20,400
Well, what we can do is pass this new note ref down to add edit note child component using v model.

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,810
Then we can hook it all up using model value and update model value.

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:31,320
So first let's set the V model of this add edit note component to new note, which was originally bound

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,960
to the text area so we can add a V model directive and set that to new notes.

8
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:43,770
Save that and we can now receive the value of this V model in a add edit note component using the special

9
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,850
model value and then we can bind that prop to this text area.

10
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,020
Do you remember how we do that?

11
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,840
Feel free to pause the video and give it a try.

12
00:00:52,050 --> 00:01:00,630
So what we need to do is add a script, set up tags, and we need to receive the value of this V model

13
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,870
using the model value prop.

14
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:12,450
So we need to set up props and we do that by adding a constant called props set by equal to the define

15
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:13,980
props method.

16
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:18,270
And we can pass our props in here and we want to receive the model value.

17
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,320
Prop on the type is going to be string.

18
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,040
This is going to be required.

19
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,140
So we'll set required to save that.

20
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,950
We can now bind this model value prop to the text area.

21
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,640
We can do that by just setting the V model to model value and I'll save that to check.

22
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,360
This is working.

23
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,280
Let's jump to a few notes that view.

24
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:50,090
I will change the default value of this new note ref.

25
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,270
And that's here.

26
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,670
So I'll stick some text in there, save that.

27
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:00,140
And we can say that text is getting through to the text area in our new reusable component.

28
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:04,690
However, if we output this new note ref somewhere on our page.

29
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:14,390
So let's say we had a pretext after this odd edit note component and we just output new notes, save

30
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:17,870
that reload and then we make a change to the text area.

31
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:24,290
We can see the value of this new note ref is not being updated and so what we need to do in our new

32
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,070
child component.

33
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:32,390
Edit Note W is explicitly let the parent component know a few notes that view when the value in the

34
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:35,690
text area has changed so that it can update the value.

35
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,060
In this new note ref and we can do that using update model value.

36
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,880
So let's jump to add edit note w and you remember how we do that.

37
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,530
Again, feel free to pause and try and do it yourself.

38
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,640
But what we need to do is set up our omits.

39
00:02:54,380 --> 00:03:03,170
So create a constant called emit so the equal to the define emits method and we could pass in our emit

40
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:10,400
events into this define emits array and we want to add the event update code on model value.

41
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:16,580
This is a special event which will allow us to directly modify a value that's coming from the parent

42
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:22,940
component by a V model without having to emit any events from the child component and listen out for

43
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,800
those events and then make the change.

44
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:30,080
So update model value allows us to modify this new note ref, which is on its parent component.

45
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:36,170
So let's jump back to add edit note w and what we can do here is listen out for the input event on this

46
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:40,250
text area which will be triggered every time we make a change to this text area.

47
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,260
So we can just add that input.

48
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:51,320
And what we want to do is emit with emit and we want to emit the update column model value event.

49
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:57,290
We need to pass in the value that we want to set up to assign set the value that's being passed down

50
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:01,130
with the V model on the parent component as the second parameter.

51
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:05,810
And so we can just set that to model value, save that, let's see if that's working.

52
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,560
Reload this page, change the value of the text area.

53
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:15,710
And yeah, we can see this pre tag on the view notes dot view component is being updated.

54
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:21,470
So we know that this new note ref on the parent component is being successfully updated by the child

55
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:27,320
component add edit note up view by listening out for the input event on the text area and then emitting

56
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:34,310
the update model value event passing in the latest value which will then directly update the value of

57
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,610
the model you note, which we're passing in here.

58
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,890
So before we move on, let's remove this pre tag that we added on all of this code that we commented

59
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:43,190
out.

60
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,210
Get rid of that.

61
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,580
And we also need to set the default value of new note up to an empty string.

62
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,800
Save that reload.

63
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,100
Let's make sure everything is working.

64
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,790
So I put a new note, click on the button and the new note was added.

65
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:03,830
However, we see an error in our console, cannot read properties a note reading focus.

66
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:09,770
And that's because in this line here, after we add a new note by sending the note content to our add

67
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:16,370
note action in our store, we're trying to focus an element which has a template ref of new note ref.

68
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,430
And this ref no longer exists on this component.

69
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:24,500
This template ref is now down in the child component add edit note dot view here.

70
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:29,600
And so that's why this text area is not focusing after we add a new note and that's why we're seeing

71
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,080
this error.

72
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,490
So let's fix that next.

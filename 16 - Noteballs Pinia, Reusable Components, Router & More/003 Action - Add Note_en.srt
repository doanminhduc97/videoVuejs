1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:07,170
Let's add an action to our A store which will allow us to add a new note to this notes array which is

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,420
in our state in our penny store, thus adding the new note to the page.

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,940
Since these notes allow coming from these notes right in our state.

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,900
Now, if we try to add a new notes right now, we see an error.

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,190
Notes is not defined.

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:26,310
That's because if we go to view notes dot view on this add note method on this line here, we're trying

7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:32,850
to add a new notes object to this notes array ref which no longer exists here, but we now want to add

8
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,300
a new note object to this notes array which is in our opinion store.

9
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:43,380
So let's jump back to the penny site and jump to what is Penny a basic example and it shows us here

10
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,150
how we add actions to our store.

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:51,150
So we just need to add an object named actions after our state and we can place all of our actions in

12
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:51,450
here.

13
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:57,540
I remember actions are just methods which allow us to access the data in our state and then modify it.

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,950
So let's jump back to store notes and for now I'll just collapse the state method and object by just

15
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:11,160
clicking this little arrow, and after this will add an object called actions and we can now place all

16
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,210
of our actions in here.

17
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,000
So let's create a new option called add note.

18
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:22,140
And for now, I'm just going to log out a note and say that we can now trigger this action from anywhere

19
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:22,860
within our app.

20
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,380
So let's trigger it from view, notes dot view.

21
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,410
And we could just trigger this action directly on our Add new notes button here in this clip.

22
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,550
And we're pulling in our store as store notes.

23
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,910
So to access our store, we could just add store notes and then to access the action, we've just added

24
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:42,690
notes.

25
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,260
We can just add dots, add notes, and we don't need to add parentheses to this method when we're triggering

26
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,160
it in our template.

27
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,020
So let's save that and see if that's working.

28
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,970
I'll type in a note and click add new notes and yeah, we can see a note being locked out.

29
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,200
So this is successfully firing our action.

30
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:06,450
However, if we jump down to our previous ADD note method which is on view notes dot view, we have

31
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,890
these two lines at the bottom.

32
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:14,670
This one which is clearing out the new notes, ref those clearing the text area and this line which

33
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:21,690
is focusing the text area by using this template ref that we've set up which we've added to the text

34
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,320
area here.

35
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:29,280
Now we're not going to have access to this remodel to clear out all this template ref to focus the text

36
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:36,000
area from within our store so it makes sense to continue to trigger this local method.

37
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:41,730
Add note when we click on the odd new note button and then trigger our action from here so that we can

38
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:46,620
still fire these two lines at the bottom, which are going to clear out the text area and focus the

39
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,310
text area.

40
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,640
So let's change that.

41
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:55,590
Click on the add new note button back to what it was triggering this local Add Notes method and we'll

42
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:02,580
comments how all of this code which was setting up the new note object and then on shifting it to notes

43
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:08,340
array ref which we had here before and then will trigger the action in our store instead.

44
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:14,880
So we can just do store notes, dot odd notes, and when we're triggering an action from our script

45
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,880
section, we do need to add parentheses.

46
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:21,300
So let's save that and see if that action in our store is still being triggered.

47
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:26,730
I'll reload, type in a note and click the button and yet we can see a note being displayed.

48
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:32,160
Well, this action needs to know what we should actually add to our notes right in the state.

49
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,960
So we need to actually pass the content of this note which has been typed into the text area to this

50
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,440
option.

51
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,410
So we can set up a new note object based on this content and then add it to our notes array that's in

52
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:43,950
the state.

53
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,110
We could do this using parameters.

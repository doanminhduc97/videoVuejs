1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:07,750
So we can now create, read and delete notes, but we can't currently update a notes.

2
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:14,740
So that's complete crud set up create read update delete by creating a new edit note page which will

3
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,200
allow us to edit a note and save it.

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:23,110
For this, we're going to be adding a new action to any store and also our first getter.

5
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:27,520
But for now, let's just set up a new route page for editing a note.

6
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:34,510
So when it jump to our Explorer and in the Views folder, I'm going to create a new file called View.

7
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,710
Edit Note.

8
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:40,810
Don't view a lot of template tags to begin with.

9
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:46,330
I'm just going to get a diff with a class of edit dash notes and inside that a lot of hate one tag which

10
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:49,660
just says edit notes on save that.

11
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,510
And now we need to set up our route.

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,450
So let's jump to source router and index dot jess.

13
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:02,350
A lot of new route here after the few notes route when to select all that and press alt shift and dow

14
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,930
shortcut might be different for you to duplicate that.

15
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:11,110
I will set the path to edit notes in order to follow this route to know which notes that we're going

16
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,660
to actually edit load into the page.

17
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,810
Then we're going to need to pass a routes parameter to this path.

18
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:22,420
So to do that, we can just add slush and then colon and then the name of a parameter and we could just

19
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,020
call it ID.

20
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:29,650
So in other words, we could visit the edit, note slash ID one and then we can grab that ID I'd want

21
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:33,370
on this view and then use it to grab the appropriate notes.

22
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:38,710
In our notes are right in our state, in our store, and then display the contents of this notes in

23
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:42,310
a text area on this page so that we can then edit it and save it.

24
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,230
Let's change the name of this route.

25
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:51,790
To edit Dash notes, we need to import our new component so we'll duplicate this import view notes line

26
00:01:51,820 --> 00:02:00,280
and replace view notes with view edit notes and then I'll copy this name view edit now paste it in here

27
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,420
so I'll save that.

28
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:09,789
We should now be able to visit parts such as edit notes, slash ID one and get to our new edit note

29
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:10,330
page.

30
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:15,340
Okay, now we need to be able to get to this page without having to type in the address bar.

31
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,160
So let's hook up these edit buttons.

32
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,590
I'm just going to close everything here except note dot view and let's find our edit button and that's

33
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:23,890
here.

34
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:29,120
I'm going to break this up onto new lines and then split the attributes on the opening text.

35
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:32,530
And we can actually just change this into a routes of view component.

36
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,920
Instead of an attack.

37
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,880
So let's rename the tag to root a link.

38
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:46,710
Make sure the closing tag is renamed as well, and we can now just add a two to this to tell it where

39
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,220
to go.

40
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:53,040
So I'm going to use a template string to do this using tactics so that we can output the ID and we want

41
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,490
to go to the path slash edit note which we set up in our route to file and then slash and then we'll

42
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:03,570
use dollar curly braces to output the ID on again.

43
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:09,750
We're passing the note objects down to this note dot view component using this notes so we can get access

44
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,440
to the ID, props notes, the ID or in the template.

45
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,850
Just note the ID.

46
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,930
So in here we can just put notes Dot's ID and let's save that.

47
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,810
See if these edit buttons are working.

48
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,690
Click on the first edit button on yet the path edit note slash.

49
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:32,280
I'd want to jump back click on the second edit button and we're now on the path edit note slash ID too.

50
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:39,780
We can access this root parameter which we've named ID in our route to file here in our template by

51
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,640
using the dollar route object, which we could also use the options API.

52
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:49,680
So let's just spit out this route parameter ID on the page and see if that's working.

53
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,230
So we want to open up our new view.

54
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,820
Edit Note Component.

55
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,690
So source views view edit note and let's change this.

56
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:07,380
Heading to edit notes with on ID of and then we'll do double Kelly braces and to access our routes information

57
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:14,250
we cannot route and then to access our routes parameters we can do doc params and then to access our

58
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:18,630
ID parameter which we set up here, we can just do dot IP.

59
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:22,019
So hopefully this will be spitting out our notes ID on the page now.

60
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:29,250
So let's save that reload and yeah, if we're at the path edit note slash I'd say we see ID two on the

61
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:35,700
page and if we click on the first edit button and we go to the path edit note slash 81, we now see

62
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,230
ID one on the page.

1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:10,650
Let's import this pioneer store we've created into View Notes Dot View Notes Page and use the notes

2
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:17,040
array that's in our store to display our notes on the page instead of using the notes array, which

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,710
we've hardcoded into view notes dot view.

4
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,720
So first of all, we need to import our store into view notes that view.

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,580
We want to import this constant here, use store notes.

6
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:38,430
So let's jump to view notes that view and look to our imports and we'll just add import curly braces.

7
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,580
Use store notes from at slush stores.

8
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,650
Slash store notes.

9
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:47,880
Say that.

10
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:53,380
Reload and to get access to the store.

11
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,460
In our component, we need to assign it to a constant or variable.

12
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,300
So a lot another block comment here which says store

13
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,200
and will create a constant called store notes.

14
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:15,070
On a sign that to use store notes, parentheses, save that.

15
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:19,460
And now that we've done that, we should be able to see our store in our view.

16
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:26,090
DevTools So let's click on this little double arrow and then view and it says in the console store note

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,670
store installed and we can see our store there.

18
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:29,780
We click on that.

19
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,510
We can see our notes are array.

20
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,350
And all of the data from each note.

21
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:44,570
Now let's output these notes from the notes array that's in our store instead of from the array that's

22
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,730
hardcoded into few notes that view here.

23
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:53,660
So we can just jot two notes component on instead of V for notes in notes.

24
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:59,390
We can do V for notes in then the name of our store, which is store notes.

25
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,720
So we can do store notes.

26
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,180
And from that store, we want to access the notes.

27
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,630
Right?

28
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:10,370
So we can just do notes on save that reload.

29
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:19,450
We can still see our notes on the page, except now they're coming from our store instead of this array,

30
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,180
which is, in our view, notes W component.

31
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,240
So we should now be able to just get rid of this notes array and save that.

32
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,010
We can still see notes on the page.

33
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,590
And if we go to the DevTools.

34
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,930
And we changed the content in one of our notes.

35
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:48,740
Now we can see our notes all day in real time on the template as well.

36
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,020
I'll just reload that.

37
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:57,740
And if we jump to store notes, don't just change the content of one of these notes.

38
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,110
I'll just remove some of the text and save it.

39
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:04,600
And I mentioned earlier on that hot reloading doesn't seem to be working at the moment.

40
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:09,240
We didn't see the hot reload when I changed the content of this note in the store.

41
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,760
And I also showed you that there's a guide on the PDA site if we scroll down here.

42
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,620
Module replacement.

43
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,700
We attempted to get this work in based on this example, and it wouldn't work.

44
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:25,580
And I still haven't managed to find a way to get this work in at the time I'm recording this, but feel

45
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,840
free to give it a try.

46
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:32,390
Maybe it's working now in the future where you are, and if you do find a solution, please share it

47
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,420
with this lecture.

48
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:38,450
And if I find a solution and a lot of lectures to this course explaining that.

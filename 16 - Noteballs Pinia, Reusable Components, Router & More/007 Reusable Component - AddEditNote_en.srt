1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:01,670
Okay.

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:07,080
So what are we actually going to need on this new edit note view that we've created in order to edit

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,390
a note and save it?

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:14,660
Well, basically what we need is a text area which we can load the note into and allow the user to edit

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:14,840
it.

6
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,930
And we need a save button so the user can save it.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,540
So basically what we need is if we go back exactly what we have at the top of our notes view here,

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,610
we just need a text area and a button.

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:33,800
Now we could just jump to our notes, view and source views, view notes, and we could just copy this

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,440
card element and all of the fields inside it.

11
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,990
Paste that into view, edit no view and then repurpose it.

12
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:48,380
Well then we'll be duplicating code and we always want to avoid duplicating code as much as possible

13
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:53,570
so it makes more sense to create a reusable component out of this card.

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,620
The text area on the bottom that we can use anywhere within our app.

15
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:01,580
So let's jump to our Explorer in our notes folder.

16
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:09,380
Let's create a new file called Add edit note dot view because we are going to be able to see both ADD

17
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,900
and added to note using this component.

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,990
Let's add template tags.

19
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:20,810
Now let's jump to view notes dot view and we'll copy this markup.

20
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:26,450
So this did with the class of card and all the stuff inside it will copy that.

21
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,990
Paste it into our template here in our new component.

22
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,460
Now let's remove all of the dynamic stuff which will break here.

23
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,550
So let's remove this view model from the text area and remove this.

24
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:44,030
Click on the disabled prop from the well to save that.

25
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:50,240
Now we want to be able to control the buttons that get displayed here because on our notes page we want

26
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,670
this new note button, but on the edit page, then we probably want a button that says save or save

27
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:56,990
note or something like that.

28
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,860
And we might also want to be able to add more than one button as well.

29
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,240
So let's create a slot here where we can insert any button that we want.

30
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:12,890
So I'm just going to get rid of this button and instead will add a slot and we'll make this a named

31
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:13,380
slot.

32
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,110
So a lot of name attribute and set that two buttons, save that.

33
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:24,530
Now let's use this new component on our notes view and get it all working that before we then use it

34
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,120
on our new edit page.

35
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:33,950
So let's jump to view notes dot view and we'll import this component that we just created that after

36
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:34,940
our notes import.

37
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:43,370
So I'll duplicate this line and we're going to import add edit note from slash component slash notes

38
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,550
slash edit notes that view.

39
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,690
Save that.

40
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,950
Now let's scroll up.

41
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,800
I will comments how all of this card element.

42
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,640
And then outputs are a new component.

43
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:02,050
Add edit notes save the.

44
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,870
We see the text area, but we don't see the button.

45
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,420
We need to press the button into a slot.

46
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:17,610
So inside this odd edit note component, we can add a template tag and we can either at the dash slot

47
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,720
colon buttons, which is the name of the slot that we set up on.

48
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,100
Edit Note View here.

49
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,710
Or we can shorthand this by just doing hash buttons.

50
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,660
We can now place outputs and it here.

51
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,990
So let's grab that from the markup that we come and sit out.

52
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:41,180
So the button is here, so I'll copy that, paste it in here and save that.

53
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:47,360
Everything looks correctly now, but it's not working because this text area, which is now coming from

54
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:54,560
our new reusable component, is no longer hooked up to this new note ref in our script section.

55
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,120
So let's fix that next.

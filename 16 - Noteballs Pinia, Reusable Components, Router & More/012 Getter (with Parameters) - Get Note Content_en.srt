1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:04,150
So how can we pass this ID to get it?

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:09,500
Well, you might think that we could just start parentheses to our get to here and pass it in like this.

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,310
Route dot params dot.

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,200
I'd say that.

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:21,820
Then just to still file down to get to and maybe pass this parameter in as a second parameter.

6
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,720
Well, we can see this doesn't work.

7
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:29,750
We see an error in the console store notes don't get no content is not a function.

8
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,380
And that's because this is not a function.

9
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:36,190
It's just an object property that's assigned to a function.

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:42,130
But we can get around this by making God gets a return a function with the parameter that we're passing

11
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:42,460
through.

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,040
So let's get rid of this ID parameter and get rid of this return line.

13
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:52,630
What we can do is just return an arrow function like this.

14
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:58,430
Pass in the parameter here so ID and let's see if we can lock this out now.

15
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:01,120
So console log on.

16
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:08,470
A lot of string key I.D. from getter colon and then we'll spits out this ID parameter, so we'll save

17
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:09,850
that reload.

18
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:16,270
Now we can see that's working ID from getter ID one and we see a warning here, but don't worry about

19
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:16,510
that.

20
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:21,220
That's just because getter is returning a function up moment and not a string.

21
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:28,450
And we're assigning that to this note content ref which is being passed to add edit note in the v model

22
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,230
on the model value prop on this component is expecting a string.

23
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:35,000
So we'll see this disappear when we get get to work.

24
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:42,040
So let's jump back to store notes as and now we can use this I.D. to grab the correct notes on this

25
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:47,170
content property from the notes array that's in our state so we can use filter to do this.

26
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,970
So inside this method here, we're going to return our notes.

27
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:57,880
All right, so state the notes, but then we're going to filter it with the filter method, stretch

28
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,530
this out a bit.

29
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,360
So this is going to loop through each item in our array.

30
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,260
So we're going to need a placeholder for each item as it's going through.

31
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,910
So we'll use note for that.

32
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:13,210
Then we add another arrow function, specify criteria for the notes that we want to grab and we want

33
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:20,410
to grab the notes where the ID property is equal to the ID property that we're passing in here from

34
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,850
our edit note page.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,640
So we want to return notes where the ID is equal to ID.

36
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:34,330
And since all of our IDs are going to be unique, that this will return an array containing just the

37
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,040
note object that we're looking for.

38
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:41,560
So since this is going to be an array, we need to grab the first and only item from the array by adding

39
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,130
square brackets zero.

40
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:47,680
And then from that we want to drop the content property so we can just do dot content.

41
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,320
Let's save that and see if this is working.

42
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:51,670
Reload the page.

43
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:52,180
Okay.

44
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:59,080
So we're edit notes id and we are seeing the content from the notes with an ID of ID one.

45
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:04,270
And if we jump back to the notes page, click on edit on the second note, then we see the content from

46
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:08,470
the second note with ID to being loaded into the text area.

1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,970
When the user clicks on this edit button, they're taken to this new edit note page and they're going

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:12,600
to expect the text of the note that they just clicked on this text here to be loaded into this text

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,080
area.

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,640
And we can do this by using a getter in our opinion store.

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,870
So what we're going to need to do is grab the ID of the current note from our root parameters, which

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:28,680
we can see in our address bar, hit ID one, and then send that ID to a getter in our store, which

7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,650
will then retrieve the correct note from our notes array in our store based on that ID and return it

8
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:35,760
to this view.

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,270
Edit Note component where we can then assign it to this note content ref which is bound to the text

10
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,190
area, thus populating the text area with the text from the correct note.

11
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:53,250
But to begin with, let's just set up a really simple getter which just gets the content of the first

12
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,480
note in our array.

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,750
So let's jump to our store file, store notes, stock.

14
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:04,830
JJ's in the stores folder and we'll scroll down and to add some guesses we just need to add a gets objects

15
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,420
up to this actions object.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,890
We can place all of our guesses in here.

17
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,810
And so to get to that we just had a property with the name of the get to that we want we could call

18
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:25,260
it get note consent and then we assign this property to a method like this so that this getter can get

19
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,940
access to US state.

20
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,730
We need to pass the state into this.

21
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,770
Gets like this and gets us.

22
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,490
Always need to return something just like computed properties.

23
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:43,440
So for now, let's just return the content from the first notes in our notes array in our state so we

24
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:50,490
can grab this from state dot notes and then square brackets zero to grab the first no dot content.

25
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,060
Let's get the content of that first note so it gets up.

26
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:02,130
All we need to do is return state dot notes, square brackets, zero to grab the first one dot content

27
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,300
and save that.

28
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,780
And we should now be able to use this getter anywhere in our app.

29
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,910
So let's use it on view edit note dot view.

30
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:19,110
We need to import our store so we need to do import use store notes from slash stores, slash store

31
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:24,300
notes that we need to assign this to a constant so that we can access it.

32
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:31,590
So a lot of new comment which says Store, I will set up a constant called store notes set that equal

33
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:38,610
to use store notes parentheses and actually let's move this up a bit to cut that paste after our imports.

34
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:44,280
And now we can use the getter in our store to grab that content from the first note on assign it to

35
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,180
this note content ref, which should then update the text area.

36
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:54,750
So to access our getter we can just do store notes dot and then the name of our getter which is get

37
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,010
notes content.

38
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:02,370
We just want to assign this to this note content ref so we can just do notes content dot value equals

39
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:02,820
like that.

40
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,590
So let's save that now reload.

41
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,050
That doesn't seem to be working.

42
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,580
Let's have a look in our console, not seeing any errors.

43
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,990
Let's have a look at a still file.

44
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,460
So make sure the app is running.

45
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,600
Yeah, it's running.

46
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,700
Oh, it help if we were actually on the edit page.

47
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,230
So let's click on an edit bottom.

48
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:22,110
Yeah, we can see the text from the first notes is being loaded into this text area.

49
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,920
However, we don't just want to grab the text from the first notes.

50
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:25,260
Right.

51
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:35,680
We need to be able to grab the content from the notes based on the idea of the note that they just clicked

52
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:35,860
on.

53
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,530
So if we click on edit on the second note, then we expect to see this notes content being loaded into

54
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:41,890
here.

55
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,170
So we can grab the ID that's being passed to this page using our root parameters.

56
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,050
And we saw earlier on that we can spit this out in our template using the route object.

57
00:03:54,310 --> 00:04:00,970
So after this add edit notes, I'll just add a pre tag double curly braces and then dollar routes dot

58
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:04,240
params and then the name of our parameter.

59
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,070
I'd say that.

60
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:12,490
So we need to pass this ID to get to so that that gets i can get the content follow the correct note.

61
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:19,899
However, we need to do this in our script section and we can't access our root information in the script

62
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:22,660
section using the dollar route object.

63
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:29,230
When we're using the composition API, we need to use view routes as new use routes composable.

64
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:39,430
So let's just remove this pre tacked on after this import here, we'll import use route from view dash

65
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:50,050
router and then a lot of comment here which just says route to and we need to assign this user out composable

66
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,640
to constant or variable.

67
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:57,880
So we'll set up a contact called routes set that equal to use route parentheses.

68
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:04,660
We can now access the same routes information which we just spat out before using this route constant.

69
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,550
So let's just see if we can log out this route parameter, this ID parameter.

70
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:14,650
So after we set up this note content rest, we'll just log out.

71
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:23,970
So consolidate log routes dot params dot i d save that and yet we can see id two is being locked out.

72
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:29,920
And if we go back to the notes page and click on edit on the first note and we see ID one being locked

73
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,190
out.

74
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,910
So how can we pass the value of this ID to getter?

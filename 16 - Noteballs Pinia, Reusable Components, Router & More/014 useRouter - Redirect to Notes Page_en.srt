1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:05,480
Let's redirect the user back to the notes view after this note has been saved.

2
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,450
So let's jump to view edit note to view.

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,320
So we need to do this in our script section after this line.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:19,790
So in the options API, we could just do this dot dollar to then not push on, push them to the top.

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,450
Well, in the composition API, this is not going to work.

6
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:24,470
So let's get rid of that.

7
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:30,080
And we need to import the use router composable from view router.

8
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,500
So let's jump up to the top on here where we're importing use route.

9
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,250
We can just add use router to that.

10
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,000
We need to assign this to a constant before we can use it.

11
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,240
So we can do that after we've set up our use route constant.

12
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:50,270
So we can just do const use actually const routes equals use router.

13
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:57,350
And we can now access all of the usual routes of methods such as push and replace and back using this

14
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:57,890
constant.

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,980
So now down to handle save collect method.

16
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:07,580
After we update the note, we can just do router push and we'll push them back to the notes page which

17
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:08,840
is up the path slash.

18
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,300
Let's say that and see if that's working.

19
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:14,930
Reload the page, change the content to save.

20
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:19,700
And yet we're back on the list of notes and we can see that the note has been updated.

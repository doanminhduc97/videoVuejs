1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:07,990
We need to pass the new notes content from view notes dot view to our new add notes action which is

2
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:08,830
in our store.

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:14,830
Before we can set up a new note object and add it to this notes array that's in our state, we can pass

4
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:20,920
parameters to actions as many parameters as we like, just like we can with any function in JavaScript.

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:26,200
So let's jump back to view notes that view and our new note content is in this new note ref which is

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,870
bound to this text area.

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:33,250
So when we trigger our action here, we can just do store notes to add notes and then pass in new notes

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,510
value and save that.

9
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:41,740
Now if we jump back to our store notes on this note action, we can receive this parameter here and

10
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:42,940
we can give it any name we want.

11
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,460
So we could call it new notes content.

12
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,530
To make sure this is getting through.

13
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,090
Let's just log it out here.

14
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,960
So new notes, content.

15
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:55,990
Save that reload, click the button and yeah, that's work.

16
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,200
And we can see our action is logging out the note that we just typed.

17
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:04,989
So now we just need to set up a new notes object like this with an ID and a content property and then

18
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:07,090
add it to this notes right in our state.

19
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,950
So let's jump back to view notes dot view.

20
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:17,350
Unless this code that we commented out say that I will paste that into our action here.

21
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,950
Remove the comments, fix the indentation.

22
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,070
We're going to need to modify this a bit.

23
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,580
So this line is still fine.

24
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,850
That's still going to get the current date on this line is fine.

25
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:33,390
It's just going to convert that timestamp into a string and assign it to this ID variable.

26
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,920
Then we up a new notes object and we're already setting up our ID, so that's fine.

27
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:43,610
But when we set the content property, we no longer want to grab this from new notes value.

28
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:47,470
We want to grab it from this parameter that we're passing in new notes content.

29
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,900
So let's copy that and paste that here.

30
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:54,490
And then when we shift this new notes object to our notes array.

31
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:59,770
We now want to push it to this notes array that's in our state, and we can access the data properties

32
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:05,590
in our state inside an action using the this keyword a bit like we did in the options API.

33
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:09,400
So to access our notes array, which is just called notes, we can just do this.

34
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:15,900
The notes that we want to on shift this notes objects into this array so we can just do this start notes,

35
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,670
start on shift parentheses around notes, and we can now just get rid of this line.

36
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,400
Now let's save that and see if this is working.

37
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,860
Type in a new note.

38
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,450
Click the button on yeah, it's work and we see it added to the page.

39
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:35,250
In depth tools we can see it's been added to our notes.

40
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,970
A right in our state here as well.

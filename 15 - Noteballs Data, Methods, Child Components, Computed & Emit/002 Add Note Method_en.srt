1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:07,500
Let's set up an odd note method which gets fired after we type something in this text area and click

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,039
the button.

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,020
Which then adds this new note to our notes array, thus displaying it on the page.

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,710
First of all, that sets up a ref, which we can bind to this text area so that we can actually get

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,140
access to the content that the user has typed.

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,180
So above our notes.

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:31,770
All right, I'm going to set up a new concept called New Notes Set that equal to a ref with a default

8
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,350
value of an empty string.

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,720
And now let's find this constant to our text area.

10
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:45,540
So we'll scroll up to the text area, which is here out of the model directive, set that to new notes

11
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,250
and save that.

12
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:53,190
And now if we type something into this ref value here, save that.

13
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,860
We can now see it in the text area.

14
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,640
So let's set that back to an empty string and save that.

15
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,300
Now let's set up a method which is fired when we click on this button.

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,380
So I'll jump up to the add new note button, which is here.

17
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:15,000
I'll split the attributes on the opening tacked on a click click and we'll fire a method called Add

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,540
Notes.

19
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,940
And now we need to create this method.

20
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,250
So we'll scroll down after our notes.

21
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,170
All right, we'll set up this method.

22
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:27,810
Const add notes equals an arrow function.

23
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,820
And for now, I'll just log out, add notes and save that.

24
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,740
Open up the console, click on this button and we can see this method is being fired because we can

25
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,210
see this log being fired.

26
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,490
Now, we don't want the user to be able to click this button if the text area is empty because then

27
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,110
they'd just be adding an empty note.

28
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,380
So let's disable this button when there's nothing in this text area.

29
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,910
So let's jump up to this button.

30
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:59,420
Which is here.

31
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:08,750
We can just bind to the disabled attribute and conditionally add this disabled attribute to the bottom.

32
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,550
And we only want to add this attribute.

33
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,630
If this new note ref is an empty string.

34
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,950
So to do that we can just do not.

35
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:27,650
New note because if that string is empty, it will count as a zero value or a false value.

36
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:28,990
So let's save that.

37
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:35,520
We can now see this button is disabled, we can't click it, and if we type something, we can now click

38
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:35,730
it.

39
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:39,240
Okay, now let's work on a note method.

40
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,800
So, first of all, we need to set up an object.

41
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:52,670
With an I.D. and a content property with the content property set to the content that's in the text

42
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:58,940
area and then push the object to this notes array and we should then see the notes on the page.

43
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,430
So first let's set up this object.

44
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:08,510
So I'll create a variable called note and set that to an object.

45
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,220
I'm going to need an ID property and a concept property.

46
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:20,060
Now the concept of property we can just grab from this new note ref, which is bound to the text area

47
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:27,170
so we can just set this content property to new note dot value.

48
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:34,220
Now for the ID we need something unique and if you like you could use a package for generating a unique

49
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:34,430
ID.

50
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,680
So it shows you id i'll just google you id and PM.

51
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:45,270
And I usually use this, you idiot version full package.

52
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,040
You can use that if you like.

53
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:53,760
But just for simplicity, I'm just going to use the timestamp in milliseconds from the current date

54
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,200
to generate this ID.

55
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,810
So above this object.

56
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,640
First going to grab the correct timestamp.

57
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,140
So we can just do new date parentheses.

58
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:11,190
And this will grab the current date as a date object and then to convert that into a timestamp in milliseconds

59
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:18,149
we can just add dot gets time parentheses and now I'm going to assign this to a variable so it can just

60
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:21,600
do let's current date equals.

61
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:26,160
Now this will actually return an integer.

62
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,420
So I'm going to convert it into a string because we're using strings here.

63
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:41,250
So sets that's another variable called I date I'll set that equal to current date dot to string to convert

64
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,690
that number into a string.

65
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:49,590
And if we want to shorthand this a bit, we can get rid of the word lat and indent that a bit and just

66
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,930
add a comma after the first variable.

67
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:58,950
We can now just set this ID property to this ID variable we set up here like that.

68
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:06,700
Or as a shorthand, since these names are both the same, we can just set this to ID like that.

69
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,790
And now let's just log out this note and make sure this is working.

70
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,980
So console log note, save that.

71
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,280
Let's add some text here.

72
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:22,960
Click on the button and we can see this object being locked out.

73
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:29,050
And yeah, we can see the content property and I can see the ID as well, which has been generated.

74
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,240
Based on the timestamp of the current date.

75
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:39,390
So now all we need to do is push this object to our notes right here.

76
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,280
And we should see the new note on the page.

77
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,710
So to get access to this notes draft, we can just do notes dot value.

78
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,270
So we can just do notes top value.

79
00:05:54,050 --> 00:06:00,830
And then to push this object to the array, we can just do that push and then note.

80
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,770
Now let's save that and see if that's working.

81
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:05,870
I'll type in a new note.

82
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:11,300
Click the button, and yet we can see the note added to the page.

83
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:16,040
And actually it makes sense for our latest note to be at the top of the list.

84
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,230
So instead of pushing get will on shift it, which will basically just stick it at the start of the

85
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,790
array instead of the end of the array.

86
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,340
So I'll just change the word push to on.

87
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,630
Lowercase on shift.

88
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,190
Save that.

89
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,750
Let's try that again.

90
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,270
And yet that's working.

91
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,710
Now it's adding it to the top.

92
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:42,400
Now, after we add the note, we can see that the text area still has the same content in it that we

93
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,870
just added as a notes.

94
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:50,590
So let's clear out this text area after we add the new note by just simply setting this new note ref,

95
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,100
which is bound to the text area back to an empty string.

96
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,530
So we can just do new notes.

97
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,610
Value equals empty string.

98
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:02,590
Let's see if that's working.

99
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,300
Click on the button.

100
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,670
And yet you can see the text area is empty.

101
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:16,800
We could also use a template ref to refocus this text area after we have the new note as well so that

102
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:23,670
the user can easily add another note straight away without having to click into this text area.

103
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:31,230
So let's jump up to the text area elements which is here a lot of ref.

104
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,930
I'll set that to new note ref.

105
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,640
We can now use this ref to focus this text area after we got the new note.

106
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,670
So let's jump back to our aid notes method.

107
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:45,580
At the bottom here.

108
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:55,170
We can just do new notes ref dot value to grab the actual text area element and then we can just do

109
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,680
dot focus.

110
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:02,400
And this should hopefully focus the text area after we have the new note.

111
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,620
So let's save that and reload.

112
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,730
Make sure that's work in.

113
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:08,540
Hello.

114
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:10,770
Out of new notes.

115
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,780
This hasn't worked.

116
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,060
New note ref is not defined.

117
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,110
Let's just scroll up and check the ref that we added.

118
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:21,990
You know, ref.

119
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:29,870
We need to actually set up a date to rest before we can use this template.

120
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:38,780
Ref So after this new note counts, let's add another const so that two new notes ref on set that equal

121
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,720
to arrests with an initial value of naught.

122
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,220
Save that and let's reload again.

123
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,440
Hello there.

124
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:49,960
Click on the button.

125
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,210
And that seems to have worked.

126
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,590
Now we've added the new notes.

127
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,520
We've cleared out the text area and we focus the text area.

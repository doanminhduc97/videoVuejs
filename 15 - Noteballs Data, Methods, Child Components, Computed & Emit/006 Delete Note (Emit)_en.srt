1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:05,550
Let's allow a note to be deleted when this delete button is clicked.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:13,320
And now that this note is in a child component knocked up, you will need to omit an event from note,

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:13,800
not view.

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:19,950
When the button is clicked, then listen out for that event on view notes dot view and then fire another

5
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,490
method here which then removes the note from the notes array.

6
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,380
Since our notes arrays in this parent component are not in this child component.

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:34,740
So first let's just trigger a local method in note dot view when this delete button is clicked.

8
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:42,000
So let's find the delete button in the template and that's here and I'll split the attributes on that.

9
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:53,220
A lot of click come to that and I'll also use the Prevent Modifier to stop this link from behaving like

10
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:59,130
a link and trying to send us to a different page and will trigger a local method called Handle.

11
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,680
Delete Collect.

12
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,069
And let's create this method.

13
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,630
So I'll add another block comment here.

14
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,970
Handle deletes clicked.

15
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,210
I will set up this method.

16
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:20,120
So const handle delete clicks equals an arrow function.

17
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,030
For now, I'll just log out.

18
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:23,720
Handle.

19
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:24,480
Delete.

20
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,190
Clicked.

21
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,270
Save that.

22
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,070
Click on a delete button and you can see that method is being fired.

23
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,610
So now we can emit a custom event from this method.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,760
Well, first of all, we need to set up our emits array.

25
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,280
Do you remember how we do that?

26
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,610
It's a little bit like how we set up props.

27
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,110
And if you want to try it on your own, then feel free to pause the video.

28
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,180
But anyway, I'm going to add a comment which says emits.

29
00:01:54,890 --> 00:02:03,120
And to set up our emits, we can create a constant called emit, set it equal to the define emits method.

30
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,310
And we can pass all of our emits in here in an array.

31
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,580
So let's define and emit called delete.

32
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:16,910
Clicked on save that and we can now emit this event from this component.

33
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,090
So back to our handle delete click method.

34
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,370
We can now just do emit parentheses and then delete clicked.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,940
Save that, make sure we have no errors.

36
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,700
Now we can listen out for this delete clicked event in the parent component view notes dot view.

37
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,410
So let's jump to that component.

38
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:40,290
And jump to our notes component here.

39
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,090
I'm a lot.

40
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,910
A custom event under here.

41
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:52,960
So at Delete Clicks, which is the name we used for our remit when we received that event, let's trigger

42
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:58,000
a method in this component, so we'll trigger a method called delete note.

43
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,280
Let's create that method.

44
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:06,470
So down at the bottom, a lot of block comment which says delete notes.

45
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:16,750
Now we can set up this method const delete notes equals arrow function let's logout delete note for

46
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:23,500
now save that click on the delete button and yeah we can see this method in the parent component is

47
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,190
being fired.

48
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:30,850
However, at this point, how do we know which note to remove from the array?

49
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:37,960
We need something to identify the note that we want to delete so we could use the ID property.

50
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:44,740
So if we jump back to note dot view, we could pass the note ID along with this omit so we can just

51
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,110
not a second parameter here.

52
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:50,830
We can grab the ID from this note which we're passing down.

53
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,990
So this is going to be our props.

54
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,910
Don't note Dot's ID.

55
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,170
So in here we can just do props notes.

56
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,210
I'd say that.

57
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:09,050
Now, let's jump back to the parent component view notes dot view down to this delete note method and

58
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,780
we could pass this parameter in here.

59
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,770
So let's call it ID to delete.

60
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,050
Let's just log that out, make sure it's getting through.

61
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,180
So I need to delete.

62
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,440
Save that.

63
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:24,750
I'll reload.

64
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,930
Click on a delete button.

65
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:33,370
Yeah, we can see delete note ID one, which is the idea of the first note.

66
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,310
And if we click on the delete button on the second note, we can see delete note ID too.

67
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:46,360
So we know that this ID is going through correctly and now there's a number of ways we could remove

68
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,860
the notes from the array.

69
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:55,810
We could figure out the index of the notes based on the ID and then delete the item, which is index.

70
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:03,880
But if you want to use a one line solution and we can use filter to set this notes array to itself,

71
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:10,060
but filtered so that only the notes which don't have this ID are returned.

72
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:15,390
So what we can do here, we're going to overwrite this notes array ref.

73
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:27,470
So to access that ref we can do notes dot value and then to overwrite it we can just do equals and we're

74
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:31,310
going to do notes that value again, but this time we're going to filter it.

75
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:34,340
So don't filter our first.

76
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:39,260
We need to add a placeholder which will be used as we're looping through the array, as it's looking

77
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,430
at each item in the array.

78
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,810
So we can just use note for that that we can add an arrow function.

79
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,660
Which will be fired for each note in the array as we're looping through it.

80
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,990
And then we can just specify what we want to return.

81
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,390
I'll just stretch this out a minute.

82
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:03,800
So let's return only items in the right notes.

83
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:09,550
The ID is not equal to this idea that we're passing into this function.

84
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,850
So not equal to ID to delete.

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,220
And I think they should do it.

86
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:18,290
So let's save the reload.

87
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,530
Click on Delete.

88
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,420
We can now delete our notes.

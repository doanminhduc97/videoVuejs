1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:07,660
Let's add a computed property which displays the number of characters that are in each note underneath

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:08,890
the content of the note.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,510
First, let's set up the mock up.

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:16,580
So in note view, underneath where we're spitting out the content, we're going to add a depth and then

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,400
inside that, going to add a small tag.

6
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:25,510
And for now, I'll just put the Tex x x x characters so that we can see that on the page.

7
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:32,509
To move this text over to the right, I'm going to add a class to the depth of has dashed text dash

8
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:36,310
right on to give the text a light gray color.

9
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:44,710
I'm going to add a class of has text dash grey dash lights save that on these classes a from bulma on

10
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,480
there documented on that website.

11
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:52,900
And just to add a bit of margin, it's a lot of class of empty for margin top dash to save that now

12
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:58,300
we don't actually need a computed property to display the number of characters we could just do double

13
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:05,740
kelley braces and then notes, dot content, dot length save that we can see that works.

14
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:11,680
However, I want to use a computer property somewhere in Iraq just to remind us how we set these up.

15
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:19,780
So let's remove note that content dot length and instead will create a computer property called character

16
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:23,500
length, which displays the number of characters of the notes here.

17
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:28,000
So let's scroll down and set up this computed property called Character Select.

18
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,370
Now do you remember how to do this?

19
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:34,000
If you like, you can pause the video and see if you can up this on your own.

20
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,110
Did you manage it?

21
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,670
If not, don't worry.

22
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:45,310
So to add a computed property, first of all, we need to import the computed method from view so allowed

23
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:51,880
imports comment and we'll import computed from view.

24
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,980
And I'll just see the bottom out.

25
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:06,200
Another block comment which says character length almost sets a computer property here and we want to

26
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,150
call this character length.

27
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:13,070
So we'll create a constant called character length.

28
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:21,380
We'll set that equal to the computed method, and then we'll pass another method into this method.

29
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:29,930
And now all we need to do in here is return something, and we want to return the length of the concept

30
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:35,090
property which is in this note prop that we're passing down from view notes dot view.

31
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,540
I remember when we're in a.

32
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,550
Script section.

33
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,440
To access a prop, we do need to use this props object.

34
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,440
So to access this note prop, we can just do prop start notes.

35
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,940
And then to access the content property.

36
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,710
Within that we can just do dark content.

37
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,430
We want to crop the length of that.

38
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,930
We want to return this so we can just add return to the start.

39
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,540
Save that reload.

40
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,620
This seems to be working.

41
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:15,650
However, one thing you might notice is if we create a note that just has one character.

42
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,100
Then it still says one character's.

43
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,620
It'd be better if it said one character.

44
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:31,350
So we can adapt a computer property to spit out this word as well based on the number of characters.

45
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,800
So I'm going to jump to our computed property before I do that.

46
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:42,690
But at your pop to a template, remove the word characters here and we now only see the number.

47
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:47,190
So let's scroll back down, back to our computed property.

48
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:52,710
And before we return the value, I'm going to set up a variable called description and we're going to

49
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:57,660
set this to either character or characters, depending on the length of the note.

50
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:04,980
And we can use a ternary if statement to do this so we can do let description equals if props dot.

51
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:12,780
Note the content length is greater than one, then we can use the word characters.

52
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,200
Otherwise we'll use the word character.

53
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:23,820
And now we can just append this description variable either characters or character to the length that

54
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,810
we're outputting here.

55
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,800
So I'm going to return a template string here.

56
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,950
Place, this prop starting.

57
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:39,400
Okay, content length and curly braces like that.

58
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,220
And then a lot of space.

59
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:41,970
And then a lot.

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,140
Our description.

61
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,730
So dollar curly braces and then description.

62
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,330
Save that and that's now work.

63
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:57,690
And you can say 199 characters on one character on the note, which only has one character.

64
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,850
Now we're duplicating a little bit of code here.

65
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,860
Props, dot note, dot content, dot length.

66
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,610
So we could tidy this up a bit by putting it in a variable.

67
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:12,350
So at the top here I'll add let's, let's call it length equals prop start notes, dot content, dot

68
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:19,860
length and that I'll replace prop start note not content length both here and here.

69
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,040
I'll press command date to select both of those.

70
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:30,390
The shortcut might be different on your platform and just replace that with this variable length and

71
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,020
save that.

72
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,220
Make sure it's still working.

73
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:33,850
Yeah.

74
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,030
We see characters if there's more than one character.

75
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,070
And character.

76
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,110
If there's only one character.

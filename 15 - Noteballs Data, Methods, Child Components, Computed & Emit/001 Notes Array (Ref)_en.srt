1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:01,530
Okay.

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:03,390
So I notes pages looking pretty.

3
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:04,380
Gosh darn beautiful.

4
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,430
Now let's get this up to actually work by adding some data and methods.

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,120
We're also going to turn this note into a child component.

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,500
We're going to add a computed property for displaying the number of characters in each note.

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,830
And we're also going to set up a custom event using limit.

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,850
Well, first of all, let's set up a ref where we can store a list of notes.

9
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:31,260
So in view notes that view on a scroll down to the bottom, another script sets up tags.

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,470
I'm going to create a block comment here which says notes.

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,770
We'll set up a constant called notes set that equal to a ref.

12
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,480
We need to import this method.

13
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,090
So a lot another block comment here which says imports and again these comments are optional.

14
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,770
You don't need to add them if you don't want to.

15
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,320
So we need to import ref from view.

16
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:58,760
And now let's settle our notes.

17
00:00:58,790 --> 00:00:59,240
All right.

18
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:04,610
So we'll pass an array into this ref on each item.

19
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:08,420
In the array will be an object, a large, an ID field.

20
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,790
Just set up to ID one.

21
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,190
I'm a lot of content field for the note content.

22
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,510
I'll just stick some lorem in there for some reason.

23
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:18,890
It's not working right now.

24
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,550
I'll just copy this lorem from a hard hardcoded notes.

25
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,800
Paste that in there and a lot of comma after this object.

26
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:28,760
Duplicate the note.

27
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,200
Get rid of this comma.

28
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,740
Set the ID to it to.

29
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,060
I'll just change the text on this one.

30
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,240
This is a shorter note.

31
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:40,340
We'll save that.

32
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,530
Now let's display these notes on our page using a V for directive.

33
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:52,850
And we already have a V for directive on this day with the class of card which we're using for our notes.

34
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:57,290
So I'll just change this to be for notes in notes.

35
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:01,530
So we'll use notes as our place holder as we loop through this notes.

36
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:01,970
All right.

37
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:02,780
True.

38
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,410
Set up here.

39
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,780
We also need to add a key property.

40
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,570
I will set this to note it so that this key is always unique.

41
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,890
And I'll save that.

42
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,170
And we can now see two notes on our page.

43
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:20,150
And we just need to output our content, which is going to be out notes, dark content.

44
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:27,980
So I'll select this text here in this tape with a class of content at double click basis and then note

45
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,850
the content.

46
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,070
Save that reload.

47
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,560
We can now see our two notes on the page which are now coming from our notes array.

1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,400
Let's pass down the notes object.

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:13,200
Which we're using as the placeholder in our V for loop here down from view notes that view down to note

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,670
dot view so that no dot view has access to note dot content.

4
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,020
So don't you know component here.

5
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,300
A lot of call notes and set that equal to note on say that.

6
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,320
And now if we talk to note dot view we need to receive that.

7
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:40,350
So we need to add a script sets up tasks and a lot of block comment which says props.

8
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,130
Now, do you remember how we initialize our props?

9
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:44,790
That's right.

10
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:50,460
We create a constant called props, and we set that equal to define props.

11
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,750
We can pass our props in here either as an array or an object.

12
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,660
I'm going to use an object here.

13
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,970
And so we're going to receive a prop called note, and the type is going to be an object.

14
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,830
And we definitely need this prop in order for our component to render correctly.

15
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:13,140
So we should also add required through to make this a required prop.

16
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,990
Save that and hopefully this should be working now.

17
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,550
I'll reload and yeah, everything's working again.

18
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:25,920
We can see our correct note content coming from the parent component array here.

19
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,790
Let's just make sure we can still add a new note.

20
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:32,680
Yeah.

21
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,940
We can still out a new note.

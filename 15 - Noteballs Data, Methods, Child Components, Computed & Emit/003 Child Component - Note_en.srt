00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:07,140
This View Notes component is getting quite long now and we're going to be adding some more functionality

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:13,740
to each individual now, such as displaying the number of characters displaying a modal when the delete

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,480
button is clicked and sending the user to the edit page when the edit button is clicked.

4
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:24,720
So before this view notes component gets too messy, let's create a child component for an individual

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,170
note.

6
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:31,980
So I'm going to jump to the Explorer and go to source components.

7
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,570
Let's create a new folder here for all of the components related to our notes.

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,490
So we'll call this notes.

9
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,080
And inside that I'll create a new file called Notes dot view.

10
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,570
A lot template tags.

11
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,100
And I'll jump back to view.

12
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:48,970
Notes that view.

13
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,910
Alma, select all of this, Deb, with the class of card.

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,370
Which is displaying a note.

15
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:57,810
Just copy that.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,810
Paste it into the template tags, fix the indentation and I'll just remove the v4 and the key attributes.

17
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:09,880
Save that.

18
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:14,200
Now let's jump back to view notes dot view and import this component.

19
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:26,440
So in our import section, we'll do import notes from slash components, slash notes, slash note,

20
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:27,460
dot view.

21
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,750
Save that.

22
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:35,500
Now, let's scroll up to this, Deb, with the class of card where we're displaying the note above that

23
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,590
we'll use our note component instead.

24
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,000
So note on if we can make this a self-closing tag.

25
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,730
I'll move the closing tag on to a new line.

26
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:51,220
And now we can just copy the VFR directive on the K property.

27
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,380
Paste it into this note component.

28
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:57,760
And now we can just get rid of this div or the class of card completely.

29
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,750
And save that reload.

30
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,270
We see an error here.

31
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:09,220
Cannot read properties of undefined reading content and our app is broken.

32
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:16,240
And that's because in note dot view in our template, we're trying to access this note object and this

33
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,520
content property from that object.

34
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:23,920
But this note object doesn't exist within the context of this note dot view component.

35
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:31,180
So we need to pass this down from view note stop view down to note w using a prop.

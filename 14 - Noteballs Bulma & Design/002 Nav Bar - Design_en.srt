1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,950
Let's add a nice, beautiful number to our app.

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,720
Now, first of all, let's just create a component for it which will import into view.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,430
And for some reason my components folder has disappeared.

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,430
But you should have a components folder here.

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,820
I'm going to create the components inside that.

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,310
I'm going to create a folder called layout.

7
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:24,220
And I don't like the way these code groups are folders together like this by default.

8
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:30,080
So I'm just going to fix up my going to code and preferences and settings and I going to search for

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:30,800
compact.

10
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:37,820
Now we can just uncheck this compact folders option and we now have a normal folder system here.

11
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:44,660
So inside the layout folder, I'm going to create a file called NAV Bar Dot View and for now we'll just

12
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:51,800
start our template tags just out of Dave with my now bar for the text.

13
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,890
Now let's jump to that view and import this component.

14
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,000
So a lot of our script sets up tags.

15
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,410
I'm going to add a block comment here which just says imports.

16
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:16,190
And then we'll import not far from slash components, slash, layout, slash, not bar dot view.

17
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,550
And I use these big comments to split up my code into sections.

18
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:24,120
I just find it makes it a lot easier for me to scan through my code.

19
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,620
Well, this is entirely optional.

20
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,040
You don't need to add these comments if you don't want to.

21
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,790
Now, let's take this not bar component on the page.

22
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,360
So I'm going to get rid of these routes of view length for now and just output on up.

23
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,100
I'll save that.

24
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,290
And yeah, we can see mine up on the page.

25
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,490
So now let's jump to the BOMA site and we're going to go to Components and number.

26
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:52,380
Scroll down, stretch this out a bit and we're just going to copy this example here for a basic number

27
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,550
and then we're going to modify it.

28
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:59,690
So I went to copy all of this code, move this back over and then we'll jump soon enough by you, paste

29
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:04,820
it all in here, indent that save and we can now see.

30
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:12,050
Now I'll just zoom out a little bit and I want end up lots of nice green color instead of white.

31
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,190
And we can do that by adding a class to this nav element.

32
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,260
Have split the attributes.

33
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:21,520
I'm not using the split YAML attributes extension which we installed earlier.

34
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:27,800
A lot of class of is dash success say that we now have a nice green number.

35
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:32,570
And again, I'm not going to be explaining all of these classes from Boma too much because I want to

36
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:36,170
stay focused on view on the composition API as much as possible.

37
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:41,150
But you can find all of these available classes on the app, on the site, for example, for this not

38
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,020
by video down.

39
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,230
Colors shows you how to add all of these different colors here.

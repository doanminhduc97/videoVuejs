1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:07,340
Now, currently the content of this number will keep stretching out as the browser gets wider and wider,

2
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,090
which doesn't look too great, especially on really big screens.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,720
So we have the logo right over here and then these links right over here.

4
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:20,180
I'd like all this to be constrained in the middle after a certain point, and we can use bonus container

5
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,170
element to do this.

6
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:26,710
So I'm going to surround everything inside an up with a dev with a class of container.

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,970
So I've just minimized everything that's in there and a lot of depth for the class of container to make

8
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:37,970
sure it constrains once the browser is wider than a certain number of pixels out of class of is dash

9
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,590
max dash desktop.

10
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,800
And these classes are all documented on the bonus site.

11
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:48,670
And then I'm just going to move this not pop round this not bar menu into that div and save that and

12
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:54,410
we can now see a larger screen's everything is constrained to the middle of the page.

13
00:00:54,830 --> 00:01:00,680
Now, if our view gets below one or two four pixels, we see the novel length disappear and we see this

14
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,560
little burger icon, but nothing happens when we click it.

15
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:09,470
That's because in order to show the mobile menu change this icon into its active state, we need to

16
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:15,110
add a class of is active to both the burger icon and the now menu as well.

17
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,430
This is all documented on the KNOP on the page.

18
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,940
But just to demonstrate this, let's hardcoded those classes in now.

19
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,330
So I'm going to split the attributes on this tag with a class of not pop burger.

20
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:35,890
I'm going to add a class of is active and save that we can see the icon change to an X and if we scroll

21
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:39,970
down to this not menu dip, I'll also split the attributes on that.

22
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,770
I'll have the same class to this div.

23
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:46,630
So is dash active save that we can now see the mobile menu appear.

24
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:51,940
So let's set up a ref to toggle these classes when we click on the burger menu.

25
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:58,480
So I'm going to remove these hardcoded classes for now from the top menu diff on the number burger attack.

26
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,310
Say that unless you're down to our script section, which doesn't exist yet, so let's create it.

27
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,060
Script sets up a lot of block comment which says mobile now.

28
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:18,940
I will set a constant called show mobile now set by equal to a ref with an initial value of false.

29
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,600
So when this is false, we won't show the mobile enough.

30
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,240
When it's true, we will show it and we need to import the ref method from view.

31
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,850
So just going to add a quick comment here.

32
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:35,140
Imports will import ref from view and save that.

33
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,680
And now let's conditionally add those classes based on this ref.

34
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,890
So let's jump to the burger icon first, which is here.

35
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,400
With a class of not bar dash burger.

36
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,870
Now lets bind to the class attributes by adding colon class curly braces and a lot of class of is dash

37
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,830
active, but only when show mobile nav is true.

38
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:03,370
And then I'll copy this and also add it to this day with the class enough bar dash menu and I'll save

39
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:03,670
that.

40
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:11,440
And now if we jump down to our ref and change the value to true that we can now see the mobile NAV and

41
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,960
the active version of the burger icon.

42
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:21,490
So let's set that back to false and we'll toggle the value of this ref when we click on the burger menu.

43
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,830
So we'll jump up to.

44
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:33,620
The nut Bob burger attack an out of click and when we click this we're going to set show mobile now

45
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,540
equal to the opposite of show mobile now.

46
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,200
So if it's false we'll set it to true and if it's true, will set it to false.

47
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,770
And because this is an attack, it's going to try and go somewhere when we click it.

48
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:52,770
So to stop that from happening, I'm just going to add a modifier of prevent and this will prevent the

49
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,590
default behavior of the element we're clicking on.

50
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,420
The default behavior of an attack is to go to another page.

51
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,320
So let's save that and see if that's working.

52
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,200
Click on the button and we see the mobile number page.

53
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,120
Click it again and we see it disappear.

54
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,180
Now, I don't like the fact that our mobile menu is pushing our page content down.

55
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,030
See how it's pushing this heading now.

56
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,520
I would rather it was just position absolutely over the top of our page.

57
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,390
So let's just add a little bit of style to make that happen.

58
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,260
So let's scroll down to the bottom and I do style tag.

59
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,090
A lot of media query here for mobile.

60
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:38,440
So media lacks width one, two, three pixels because that's when the mobile nav styles kick in.

61
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,200
When we scale down the browser.

62
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:46,770
And now we want to target on up menu, which is this step here with the class of up dash menu.

63
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:55,890
So I'm just going to add dash bar dash menu set up to position absolute and set the left to zero and

64
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,020
set the width to 100%.

65
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:03,600
Save that click on the button and our mobile menu is now positioned over the top of our content instead

66
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,680
of pushing it down.

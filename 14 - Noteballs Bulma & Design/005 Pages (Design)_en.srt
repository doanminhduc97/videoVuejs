00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:05,520
Before we start working on the design of our notes page, the main page in our.

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,470
First of all, I'd just like to constrain the content of all of our pages and also add a little bit

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:16,320
of padding because right now we can see the content of our pages is right up in the corner with no padding.

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,290
And also our content is always right over to the left.

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,490
Regardless of how wide browser is, which doesn't look too pretty.

6
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:30,900
So I'm just going to use the same classes that we use to constrain the content in an upper u container

7
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,970
and max desktop classes.

8
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:39,150
And so to do this, I'm going to update view and just surround our route to view in a dev with these

9
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:39,680
classes.

10
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:48,210
So container and is mux desktop just move the roots of view into that and save that.

11
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,090
We can see our content is now constrained.

12
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,710
Boma has some padding classes we can use to add a little bit of padding around our pages as well.

13
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,290
And these are all documented on the OMA site.

14
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:06,900
So a lot of class of PDX dash two to add some horizontal padding and then a class of P dash for to add

15
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,980
some vertical padding.

16
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:13,240
And this is looking good now on smaller screens, on wider screens.

17
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,630
A logo isn't lining up with our content.

18
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,320
I think it would look better if this lined up.

19
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,020
So let's add some padding to our lap bar as well.

20
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:27,740
So our Johnson up view and then this contain tape that we added and a lot of classic stuff too.

21
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,270
And that's looking pretty good now.

22
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:38,070
And now let's give all of our pages a little background color, which matches the color of our number.

23
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:42,750
So I'm going to go to the file Explorer and open up index dot HTML.

24
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:49,950
I'm going to add a class to a page HTML element and BOMA has tons of color classes we can use and they're

25
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,870
all documented on the for my site.

26
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:59,620
I'm going to use the class has background dash success dash light and say that we now have this nice

27
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,400
little green color in the background of all of our pages.

1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:06,750
That sort of farm to the top of our notes view with a text area and a button that we can use to add

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:07,530
a new note.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,420
So back to the ball, Messi.

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:10,800
I'm going to go too far.

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:18,300
And General, I'm going to scroll down to complete form example, show the code and all I'm going to

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,830
grab here is from this text area down to these buttons.

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:27,540
So let's scroll down the code and there's a text area and we do want this did with the class of field

8
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,280
that's around it.

9
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:29,610
So I'll select from there.

10
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,000
To the step down here with the two buttons inside it.

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:33,660
Copy that.

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,160
And we'll paste this above our notes.

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,660
Well, still inside this day with the class of notes.

14
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,980
So a paste that here indents it a little bit and save that.

15
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,760
Now I'm going to remove this label here with the text message, which is here.

16
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,200
So get rid of that and I'm going to get rid of this checkbox here.

17
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,100
Does this step here with the class of fields?

18
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,470
So we'll get rid of that.

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,870
We'll get rid of these two radio buttons, which is this div here.

20
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,120
Save that.

21
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,310
Now I'm going to surround the text area and the buttons in a card component with a background color.

22
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,350
So I'll stick that up here.

23
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,350
So a lot of tape with the class of card to give it a background color.

24
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:17,550
Without it, class of has background success dark and I'm going to select these two Davis to the class

25
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:25,350
of fields cut those paste them inside this div save that we need to add a bit of padding here so a class

26
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,580
of P does for give it a bit padding and we need a bit of margin at the bottom.

27
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,870
So a lot of class and B margin bottom dash five save thought.

28
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,670
Now I'm going to remove this cancel button.

29
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:40,020
So I'll remove this tape with the class of control which has the console button inside it.

30
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,710
Save that and I want to pull this button over to the right hand side.

31
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,250
You can do that by adding a class of is dash grouped dash right to this day for the class of field save

32
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:56,520
that I want to change the color and the text of this button is going to break it up onto multiple lines.

33
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:00,660
I'll change the text inside it to add new notes.

34
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:07,950
Save that I will change the background color by adding a class of has dash background dash success.

35
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:08,910
Save that.

36
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:14,520
I'll finally let's change the placeholder on this text area and in fact I'm going to change this into

37
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,870
a self closing tag like that and split the attributes.

38
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:25,770
I will set the placeholder to add a new note, save that this is looking pretty good on desktop.

39
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,120
It's looking pretty good on Mobile, too.

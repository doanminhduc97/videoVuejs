1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:05,480
Now let's create the design for our notes using bonus card component.

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:10,280
So I'm going to jump on over to the bonus site and go to components on card.

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,540
Our full screen, this is EQ.

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:20,750
And I'm going to scroll down to this example here, which has these buttons at the bottom which we can

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,020
use to add the ability to edit and delete a note.

6
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:30,410
So I'm going to copy this example here by clicking on copy, and then I'll jump back to note bubbles.

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,060
I'm going to add this to our notes view.

8
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:38,330
So we're going to go to source views and view notes dot view and I'll paste that inside this diff over

9
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:44,810
the top of this H1, indent it a little bit and save that and I'm going to get rid of this head at the

10
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:45,230
top.

11
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,850
So that's this header element here.

12
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,630
So we'll get rid of that, save that.

13
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,980
And I'm just going to enable word by default.

14
00:00:52,010 --> 00:01:00,470
So I'm going to go to code preferences and settings, search for word wrap and set that to on by default.

15
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:01,490
That's better.

16
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,849
Now I'm going to get rid of everything inside this div with a class of content.

17
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,920
So get rid of that.

18
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:13,640
Spits out some room by just typing in lower and then hitting enter should see this abbreviation.

19
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:14,480
Save that.

20
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,880
I'll just get rid of the save button cause we're only going to need an edit on the delete button.

21
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:20,750
Save that.

22
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,200
Let's just see how this will look with multiple cards on.

23
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,850
A quick trick to do this is to just add av4 to the parent diff.

24
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,530
So before that we can just do I in three to spit out three of these.

25
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:37,280
And you can see we need a little bit of space between each note.

26
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:44,470
So a lot of class to this day for the class of card of and B for margin button dash for save that these

27
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,290
are looking pretty good.

28
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:49,550
Let's just make sure they look okay on a big screen or on a small screen.

29
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,390
Yeah, pretty good.

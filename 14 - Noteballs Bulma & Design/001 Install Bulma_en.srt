1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:02,960
To help us make our outlook pretty.

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:08,970
We're going to use the Bouma library, so I'm going to jump to Boma dot IO.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,510
Now this isn't a access course, so I won't be focusing on Boma and CC too much.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:21,000
We're just simply using it to help us make our look pretty without having to spend tons of time writing.

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,920
And that way we can purely focus on Vue.js three on the composition API.

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,180
Also, I'm not necessarily suggesting that you should use Boma for your projects.

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,560
You should make an informed choice based on your individual projects needs.

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,450
However, I believe Boma is currently the third most popular CC framework.

9
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,960
After Bootstrap and Tailwind CC.

10
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:48,840
However, I've chosen BOMA for this project because it's the easiest CSA framework to get started with

11
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:52,560
and it has all of the components that we're going to need for this project.

12
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:58,710
So if I jump to documentation on components, we have this card component that we're going to use,

13
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:04,830
this KNOP component that we're going to use, the modal component that we're going to use.

14
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,560
And it has a bunch of farm components that we're going to use like this input.

15
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:13,920
And it also has a nice button component that we're going to use as well.

16
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,860
So let's get Boma installed to our project.

17
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:22,680
So I'm going to jump to overview and then start scroll down and there's a few ways we can install it.

18
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:30,240
We can install it using a CD link where it will be loading in externally, or we can download it from

19
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,140
GitHub or we can install the NPM package.

20
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,160
And this is the way I'm going to do it.

21
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,360
So we need to run NPM, install BOMA, so let's copy that.

22
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:47,640
Open up our terminal, kill the dev process and run NPM, install BOMA that's installed.

23
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:54,570
And if we jump to our node modules folder, we can see Boma is here and if we open the CSC folder,

24
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,500
we can see up all the access files.

25
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,590
I'm going to use the minified version bulma documents.

26
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:05,190
SS But we can also use the own minified version for modok costs.

27
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,350
So I'm going to right click on board the document.

28
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,080
SS Click on copy paste.

29
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:13,370
That.

30
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,960
I'm going to jump to The View.

31
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,300
I'm going to add a style tag.

32
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:25,950
And to import that CSV file I'm going to add at import and then I'll paste in that path.

33
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,260
We have the full path on my computer here.

34
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,520
But we only need the path from this Bournemouth of all here.

35
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,260
So I'll remove everything before that.

36
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,160
The folder and we need to add a semicolon at the end.

37
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,880
Let's say that we need to relaunch our up.

38
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:44,240
So let's run NPM, run depth, jump back to our app.

39
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,010
Now we can see our styles have already changed a little bit, but just to make sure Obama is working

40
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:57,730
less out of class to each of our routes, a link components here of button and this should give these

41
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,050
a nice button style.

42
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:01,970
Save that.

43
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,920
And yet we can see some nice little buttons now.

44
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,960
We can now start using Burma to make our outlook beautiful.

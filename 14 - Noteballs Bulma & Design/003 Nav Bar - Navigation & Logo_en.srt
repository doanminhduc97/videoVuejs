1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:02,580
Let's customize this number.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,460
First of all, I want to get rid of this more link here with this dropdown.

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,730
So let's scroll down the part of view and see if we can find that.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,970
We can see that more link here and we can see this dip for the class of not by item.

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,160
Let's collapse that, Dave.

6
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:16,149
Just get rid of it.

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,940
Save that and we see that disappear.

8
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,090
Now let's move these two links over to the right hand side.

9
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:28,030
So I'm going to scroll up on these two nav item links here when I cut them.

10
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:29,950
Just get rid of this now.

11
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,900
Bar dash, start dip.

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:39,010
Now we're going to paste those links into this number and dip, which will put them over on the right.

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,310
So let's collapse this dip inside that now by item.

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,450
Get rid of that.

15
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,210
I'll just paste in the links we caught before.

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,650
Save that.

17
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,090
Let's make these links to notes view and our stats view.

18
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:56,480
So I'm just going to remove the second item and this first one.

19
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,560
I'm going to change this to a roots, a link component.

20
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:05,319
Make sure we change both the opening and closing text that I'm going to split the attributes on this.

21
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,410
Change the text to notes.

22
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,840
I'm allowed to prop to this route.

23
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,970
So they set that to the path slash, which is where our notes route is that I'll select this route.

24
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:21,340
So Link duplicates it and we'll change the two prop to the path slash stats.

25
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,100
We'll change the text to stats as well.

26
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:24,910
Save that.

27
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,480
We now have links to our notes and stats page.

28
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:29,560
We can see this heading.

29
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,160
Updating.

30
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:38,440
An owner has a class which is is active which we can add to one of these number items to make it appear

31
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:38,980
active.

32
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,190
You can see this link now looks active on these routes.

33
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:48,020
Link components can actually add a class to the link when that link is the active link.

34
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:55,960
So if I just cut that class, we can just add a prop of active dash class and set it to this class is

35
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,290
active and I'll also copy that and paste it to the stats link.

36
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,490
Say that we should now have active classes on our links.

37
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,920
And yet that's working.

38
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:09,669
And now let's just replace this Boma logo with a title for our app.

39
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,320
So I'll scroll up to the top.

40
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:16,990
And inside this SNAP brand div, we have this attack with a class of no item.

41
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,660
I'm going to remove the image that's inside that and remove this hate trap.

42
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:28,150
I don't want to change this attack into a depth because I don't want this to be a link that inside that

43
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:33,970
I'll just have the text, no pulse and save that to improve the style of the text here.

44
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:41,290
I'm going to add a class to this depth of is dash size does fall to make it a bit bigger and that class

45
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:48,250
of is dash family mono space to give it this mono space style font.

46
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:53,020
And again, you can find all of these classes on the BOMA site, which is very well documented.

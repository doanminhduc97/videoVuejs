1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:06,770
While there is an option in the bill to we just use to add the browser to our project automatically.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:12,530
It's good to know how to do this manually, just in case you have to add browser to an existing view

3
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,080
three project which doesn't already have it set up.

4
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,650
So let's add the browser to our project and get it all set up.

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:25,280
So let's jump to our terminal and kill the dev process with control and say to install view out so we

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:30,140
can just run npm install view dash root at for.

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,330
Let's get the latest version of user.

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,130
And that's now installed so we can launch our project again with NPM, run dev, close the terminal

9
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,450
and see what the routes are to our app.

10
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,600
We need to jump to source and main.

11
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:52,100
Yes, we cannot be routed to our app by importing the create router method from view router and adding

12
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,770
it to this create chain with some options.

13
00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:04,739
So first of all, after this first line, we need to import create router from view dash router and

14
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:12,860
we can now use this create router method to set up our router and we need to assign this to a constant.

15
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:17,150
So we'll create a constant called router and assign this to that.

16
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,350
We want to pass in an object here with all of our routes options.

17
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:28,370
On the first option we need to add is the history mode and we can set this to either create web history

18
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,380
or create web hash history.

19
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,970
Now create web history.

20
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:37,360
We'll use real URLs in the browser when we navigate across our pages.

21
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:43,150
So for example, if we went to an about page, then the path would just be about whereas with web hash

22
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:49,850
history, we will see slash, then hash, then slush, and then about when we go to our about page and

23
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:54,680
I'm going to use the web hash history here because when we're using this mode, we don't need any fancy

24
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,940
server setup to get our app running if we decide to deploy it to a server.

25
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:04,490
So let's set this history property to create web hash history.

26
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:17,940
And we need to import that from the user base code is automatically added that for me here.

27
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,210
But if yours hasn't, then just add it to this import.

28
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,890
On the next option we need to add is our roots.

29
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,620
So we create a property called routes.

30
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:30,000
Set that to an array and we can set up all of our routes in here.

31
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,990
But before we do that, let's add this router instance to our app.

32
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:38,250
So after this create app, we can add the use method to this chain.

33
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,590
Don't use parentheses, we can just pass in this route.

34
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,230
So constant.

35
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:48,390
I'm just going to break this up onto multiple lines and save that.

36
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,760
Let's make sure we're not seeing any errors.

37
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,260
I'll reload and I think this error might just be because we haven't set up any routes yet.

38
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,580
So let's do that next.

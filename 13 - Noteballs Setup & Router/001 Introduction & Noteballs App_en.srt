1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,810
We're going to spend the rest of this course taking everything we've learned to create this real world.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,109
Note taking up called note balls.

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:13,550
Creating this app will allow us to take all of our new knowledge of the basics of the composition API

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,960
and solidify that knowledge with the creation of a real world app from scratch.

5
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:20,900
So in this app we can display a list of notes.

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,100
Each note has the notes on the number of characters and an edit and delete button.

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,530
We can add a new note.

8
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,860
And we can edit a note and save it.

9
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,370
We can delete a note as well with this confirmation model.

10
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:41,580
And we also have a header with links to our two pages, notes and stats.

11
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:47,120
And we have this stats page where we display stats related to our notes, including the number of notes

12
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,270
we have and the total number of characters of all our notes.

13
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:56,570
It's also going to look presentable, as you can see, by using the Boma CSS library, and it's also

14
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,040
going to be responsive as well.

15
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,890
So on desktop, we have these links to our two pages.

16
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:06,200
But if we scale this down, we can see all of the elements scaled out for mobile and our links in the

17
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,150
header changed to this little bigger icon.

18
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,010
Let me click on that.

19
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,060
Could see the links to our two pages.

20
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,390
This app is going to make use of almost every concept that we learned earlier on in the course, including

21
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:21,240
view routes on the use routes and use routes and posibles.

22
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,700
This time we're actually going to install the URL to set it all up from scratch.

23
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:30,360
It's going to use reactive data, including refs and reactive objects.

24
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,850
It's going to use methods, computed properties and watches.

25
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:39,200
It's going to use child components, including props limits and update model value.

26
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:45,770
It's going to use template refs on composable, including custom composable and a composable from the

27
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,180
view use library.

28
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:52,940
It's going to use directives and lifecycle hooks and we're going to set up all of our apps, state management

29
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,900
using Peneha.

30
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:58,940
Although this time we're actually going to install Peneha on set up our Peneha store completely from

31
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,520
scratch.

32
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:05,360
And of course, we'll also be adding state actions and a whole bunch of ghettoes to our Peneha store.

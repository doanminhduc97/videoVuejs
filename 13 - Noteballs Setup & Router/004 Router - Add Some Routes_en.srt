1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:07,430
Let's set up some routes for our app and our app is going to have a notes view page and a stats view.

2
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,450
So let's set up a routes for our notes view first.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,180
Well, first of all, we're going to need a component that we can use for that notes view.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,250
So let's jump back to the File Explorer and we'll right click on the source folder.

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:23,260
I create a new folder called Views and this doesn't have to be called views.

6
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,410
You could call it pages if you like, but I'm going to call it views.

7
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:34,570
Let's create a new component in that I'm going to call this view notes dot view without template tags

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:35,770
on.

9
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:41,500
For now, I'll just add a div with a class of notes and inside that, a lot of each one that just says

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,010
notes.

11
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,910
Save that and we can now use this component for our notes view.

12
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:47,650
So let's jump back to Main.

13
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:48,460
Yes.

14
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,350
And add a route for our notes view.

15
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,720
For each route in our app, we need to add an object with some options.

16
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:02,260
First of all, we need the path option and this will determine what path will take us to this route.

17
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,570
I'm going to set the path to slash for the notes view, which just means this will be the route route

18
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:08,170
of our app.

19
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,610
So when we first visit our app.

20
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,260
This is the route that we'll go to.

21
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,960
Now, we also need to add a name property.

22
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,110
I'll set this to notes.

23
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:22,870
And this name property makes it easier for us to send the user to a particular route programmatically.

24
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:29,080
Finally, we need to add the component property, which we just set to the component that we want to

25
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,460
use for this route.

26
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,340
So first of all, we need to import our component.

27
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:42,040
So we'll import view notes from at slash views slash view notes dot view.

28
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:47,920
Now in previous view builds which used Webpack, we didn't need to put the top view here, but when

29
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,990
we're using beat, which we are now, we do need to add dot view and also this symbol here.

30
00:01:53,380 --> 00:02:00,010
This is just an alias which refers to this source folder and this alias is being defined in this beta

31
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,170
dot config file.

32
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:03,490
We could see that here.

33
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,330
And you can also add your own aliases to different folders if you want to.

34
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,350
But anyway, let's jump back to Main as we can now set the component for this route.

35
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,410
So we'll set this to view notes.

36
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,740
Let's save that and reload.

37
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,560
We still have an error here and I've just figured out what the issue is when we set the history to create

38
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,820
web hash history.

39
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:29,080
This needs to be a method call, so we just need to add parentheses to the end of that.

40
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,660
Save that the app is now working again.

41
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:37,360
However, we can't see this notes view that we've just created in the browser, and that's because we

42
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,040
need to add a routes of view component to our app, to our route component app dot view.

43
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:46,420
I will do that in a minute, but before we do that, let's just set up a route for our stats page.

44
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:54,580
So let's jump back to the views folder and duplicate view notes dot view and we'll call this view stats

45
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,240
dot view.

46
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:03,100
I'll just change the class on the dev to stats and we'll change the text in the heading to stats as

47
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:03,460
well.

48
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,220
Save that jump back to Main.

49
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,060
Yes.

50
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,570
Let's add a comma after this route and duplicate that.

51
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:15,970
By the way, I did that by selecting this text and pressing alt shift and down and the shortcut might

52
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,150
be different on your platform.

53
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:22,720
Now let's get rid of this comma here and we'll set the path to slash stats so that when we go to slash

54
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,000
stats, we get to the stats view, we change the name to stats as well, and now we need to set the

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,560
component to our stats view.

56
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,030
But first we need to import it.

57
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:38,470
So I'll duplicate this Blue Notes line and we'll import view stats from slash view slash view stats

58
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,030
dot view and save that.

59
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:47,290
And we just need to change this component to view stats say that, but we still can't see our notes

60
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,340
view on the page.

61
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:55,480
If we go to the path slash and we can't see the stats view, if we go to the path slash stats and that's

62
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,210
because we need to add a root to view component to our app.

63
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,500
So let's do that next.

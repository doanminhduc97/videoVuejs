1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,430
Let's create a brand new view.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,410
Three projects for Note Balsa.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,230
So let's jump on over to The View three website.

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:12,030
I'll search for View three and jump to the 3.5. org.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,700
Earlier on in the course, I told you that the docs are about to be massively revamped and I had to

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,170
change the URL to get to the new docs.

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,450
But it looks like the new docs are now live.

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,430
So we can just jump to install gold now and again.

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,450
We need to have no jazz installed, but you probably already have that installed at this point.

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,510
So let's create a new view project with this command.

11
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,810
So I'll copy that jump to my terminal NPS code.

12
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,270
And again, we can toggle this with control and back to it.

13
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,780
I'll make sure you're in the folder way you stole your projects.

14
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,840
You definitely don't want to run this in the previous projects folder, if that's where you are.

15
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:51,750
So I'll paste that in and launch that and I'll type in Y to agree to install create view.

16
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:59,200
And for the project name and the project folder, I'm going to use view dash composition API Dash Note

17
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,740
False.

18
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:04,569
But you can use any folder name you like and I'm going to choose no to all of the options.

19
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:08,710
We're not going to install value out to this time because going to install that from scratch and set

20
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,760
it all up from scratch.

21
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,380
So no on again with pen.

22
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,940
Yeah, we're going to set that up from scratch.

23
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,640
So I'm going to choose no, no, no.

24
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,620
And you might want to consider using your own projects to help you ensure code quality.

25
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:25,240
But for simplicity, I'm just going to choose notes of this and we have some launch steps here.

26
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:30,370
So we just need to see into the folder and run NPM install to install the dependencies and then run

27
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,520
npm run dev and I can see the folder it's created here.

28
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,200
Composition API, no pulse.

29
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,300
So when to drag that into B code?

30
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:43,630
And then open up the terminal and ruin AMPM and store.

31
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,730
And then AMPM run dev to launch it.

32
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,070
Okay, now we can come on and click on this link.

33
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,230
We can see the basic hop running in the browser.

34
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:00,070
Before we get started, let's just change the name that is in the top there.

35
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:05,350
So I'm going to open up the explorer and go to index dot HTML.

36
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,110
I just changed the text in these title tags to note balls saved up.

37
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,720
We're now ready to get started creating note balls.

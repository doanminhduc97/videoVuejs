1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:02,680
Let me go to the slush.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:07,110
We don't see of you notes component with this heading with the tax notes.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,710
And that's because we need to add a roots of view component to our app is the route to view component

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,500
which determines where our routes will be displayed.

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:18,290
So let's jump to our route component source update view.

6
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:24,100
I'm actually just going to remove the script section, remove everything inside the template and remove

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,650
the style tag and all of the styles as well.

8
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:29,350
Save that.

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,640
We can now also delete all of the components in the source components folder.

10
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,680
So I'll select everything in here.

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,480
Right click on Delete.

12
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,240
And we see an arrow, but if we reload than the error disappears.

13
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,240
So now to display our roots, we just need to add a roots view component.

14
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,650
And we can do this in a case like this.

15
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:57,290
Roots a dash view all we can do it in Pascal case, which I'm going to do so roots a view save that

16
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,870
we can now see our notes root on the page.

17
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,610
And if we go to the path slash stats, we can see us.

18
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,220
That's for you.

19
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,370
Now, using the address bar to navigate isn't much fun.

20
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,990
So let's add some roots link components to our page so that we can navigate.

21
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:18,980
So above this route to view component, I'm going to add a roots, a link component inside that output,

22
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,680
the text notes, and then I'll duplicate that.

23
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:22,550
In this one.

24
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:27,060
We've got the text stats to determine where these roots links will go.

25
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,680
We can just add a two prop and set it to the path we want to go to.

26
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:37,640
So for the notes, you can just set this to slash and then for the stats you can just set this to slash

27
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,300
stats.

28
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,290
So let's save that.

29
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:48,700
I'll just add a space after the first one and a pipe and then another space so that we can now navigate

30
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,230
around.

1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:06,790
Our route is now all set up and working, but before we move on, let's just tidy up our code a little

2
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:07,030
bit.

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:12,400
So first of all, I'm just going to extract all of our router setup code into its own file.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,190
So in the source folder, I'm going to create a new folder called Router in there I'm going to create

5
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,540
a new file called Index Dot.

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:27,010
Jess, let's jump back to Main JS and I'm going to use a multiple selection by holding down the alt

7
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,980
key, although the shortcut might be different on your platform.

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:36,700
When I select all of this route to contact the two imports for our notes view and stats view this line

9
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:41,800
where we're importing the create router and great web hash history methods from the router.

10
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:49,030
I'm going to cut all that and just tidy this up a little bit and then talk to index dot js in our roots

11
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,710
folder, paste all that code in.

12
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:57,100
I'll just add a line after our imports and now we want to export this router instance to make it available

13
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,300
to all the files.

14
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:03,580
So at the end we can just do export default router, save that.

15
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:10,990
Now if we jump back to Main, yes, we can import this router instance by adding import router from

16
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:17,860
us slash router and we don't actually need to add index docs when we use the file name.

17
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:18,960
Index dot just.

18
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:30,610
It will always look for this file automatically so we can just do import routes from other routes.

19
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:37,810
And now when we fire use routes, we're using the router instance from an index file in the router folder.

20
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,710
So let's say that.

21
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,330
See if everything is still working.

22
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,790
Yeah, it's all still working.

23
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,230
And one more thing.

24
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,480
I'm going to jump to index.

25
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,120
Yes.

26
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,600
And I'm going to put all of these routes into their own constant.

27
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:55,810
So I'm going to set up a constant called routes, set that equal to an array that I'm going to put these

28
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,870
two objects, paste those in here.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,780
And now we can just set this routes, property to routes.

30
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:07,730
Or since these names are both the same, we could just shorthand this to just routes.

31
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,710
So let's save that.

32
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,850
Make sure it's still working and yet it's still working.

33
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:18,280
Now we've tidied up our main JS file and moved all of the code related to our routes into its own file.
